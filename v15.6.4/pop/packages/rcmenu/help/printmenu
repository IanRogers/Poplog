The sort of printing facilities available to you will depend on the sort
of text you are printing, and the kind of printer you can access.

If you have a simple text file and you have access to a postscript
printer, then you should use the "psprint" command. E.g.

    ENTER psprint
        Print whole file, default being two pages side by side

    ENTER psprintmr
        Ditto, but print only marked range

    ENTER psprint -p
        Print whole file in "protrait" mode, i.e. each page on a
        separate sheet

    ENTER psprintmr -p
        Ditto, but print only marked range

    See HELP * VED_PSPRINT


If you are using LaTeX, then you need the command
    ENTER latex print
provided that you have previously done ENTER latex, and the .dvi
file exists. See TEACH * LATEX, HELP * LATEX

If you have a simple text file and a simple printer, such as a dot
matrix printer, then you almost certainly want to use either
    ENTER lpr
        To print a complete file
    ENTER lprmr
        To print marked range

    See HELP * LPR
