I have a modified version of newc_dec which will parse
ANSI style C declarations.

I basically modified newc_dec.p so it can parse KR or ANSI C.

I did this for two reasons,

1. avoid conflict between the two variants of C so one poplog process
   can link code writen in both variants.

2. there were some variables which where lexicaly scoped to the file
   so it was easier to put the ansi_c code in the same file rather than
   sectioning everything.

There is also a stub file ansi_c_dec which just uses newc_dec
and I have quickly written a help file which points out the differences

    or in
        $usepop/pop/lib/auto/

    perhaps after saving this one:
        $usepop/pop/lib/auto/newc_dec.p
