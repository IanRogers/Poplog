    convolve_1d(ARRIN, MASK, ARROUT, REGION) -> ARROUT

This is just like *CONVOLVE_2D but for 1-D arrays. The arguments all
mean the same things except that all arrays must be 1-dimensional, as is
the array returned.

The formula is just

    ARROUT (X)  =   SUM   ARRIN (X-x)  *  MASK (x)
                     x

where x runs over all permissible indexes into MASK.

For simple uses ARROUT and REGION can be given as <false>.  See
*CONVOLVE_2D for details.
