Xpw is the Poplog Widget Set.  It contains a variety of object  oriented
user interface components (called widgets) which are controlled  through
the X Windows Toolkit (Xt). For an introduction to Xpw, see HELP * Xpw.
    This  file  describes  the  XpwComposite  widget,  and  the   Pop-11
interface to XpwComposite. See  the section on associated  documentation
for a list of other documents describing Xpw.
    Xpw is currently  written in  C. See  the section  on C  Programming
Information for more details on using the XpwCore widget in C.
    This file assumes a basic understanding of the Xt toolkit.  Concepts
such as resources, actions, translations, etc. are all introduced in the
X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface manual.

1  XpwComposite widget

     Superclass:   Composite

The XpwComposite Widget class is similar  to XpwCore, in that it  adds a
callback to  an  existing intrinsics  widget  class, in  this  case  the
Composite widget. The  XpwComposite widget uses  the callback to  notify
applications when events (like adding children, or resizing) occur.  The
XpwComposite widget is  used to manage  a set of  other widgets,  called
children. Programmers use the callback to calculate the geometry of  all
the children of  the widget.  Unlike the Form  widget, no  specification
technique for widget location is used. By default, all geometry requests
are accepted.

Because the XpwComposite widget notifies applications of resize  events,
and the applications have access to the children of the widget,  complex
geometry and location  calculations for  children of the  widget can  be
performed within the callback.

2  Synopsis

In C:

       #include <Intrinsic.h>
       #include <StringDefs.h>
       #include <X11/Xpw/XpwComposite.h>
       widget = XtCreateWidget(name, xpwCompositeWidgetClass, ...);


in Pop-11:


xpwCompositeWidget -> widgetclass                             [constant]
        A member of the Poplog Widget Set.

        To  make  available   both  the  Xpw   library  directory,   and
        xpwCompositeWidget from it, requires

            uses Xpw, xpwCompositeWidget;

        (which also makes * XpwCallMethod available). Then either of

            XtCreateWidget(name, xpwCompositeWidget, ...) -> w;
            fast_XtCreateWidget(name, xpwCompositeWidget, ...) -> w;

        will create an instance of the XpwComposite widget.




------------
3  Resources
------------

XpwComposite inherits all  of the Core  and Composite widget  resources,
and adds a single new resource, XtNxpwCallback.

    The following resources are retrieved from the argument list or  the
resource database when XpwComposite widgets are created.

 Name                    Class                   Type            Access

 XtNy                    XtCPosition             short           SGI

The following notes  describe new resources  or properties of  resources
for XpwComposite widgets.


XtNxpwCallback                                                [resource]
        This callback list is used notify clients of configure events.




---------------------------
4  Actions and Translations
---------------------------

XpwComposite  has  one  action,  "notify-configure-event".  This  action
simply calls the xpwCallback to notify clients of configure events.  The
translations for XpwComposite are:

   <Configure>: notify-configure-event()
