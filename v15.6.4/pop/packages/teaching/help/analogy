HELP ANALOGY                                          JL Cunningham, Feb 1983

The program in LIB ANALOGY is a simplified model of Evans' analogy program,
to do a certain class of IQ test questions. It is intended only as a teaching
aid, and at Sussex there is a local TEACH file called TEACH *EVANS.

When loaded, the program prints an explanatory message. Answers to requests
for the name of a "picture" can either be:
    (a) A variable whose value is a procedure to draw a turtle picture.
        LIB EVPICS contains suitable examples
    (b) A variable whose value is a list - to be used as a "picture"
        description.
    (c) If neither of the above, then the word is looked up from the
        variable DICTIONARY (try printing it to see the format).

It is unlikely that the procedures defined in this program would be of
general use, although possibly the procedure COMPGRAPH could be used in
a demonstration program to illustrate Winston's learning program - do

    ENTER sourcefile compgraph

to see the code. This procedure takes two arguments - lists of the form of
(b) above. In addition the variables "n1" and "n2" should be the names of
these arguments. The procedure assigns to *DATABASE.

See SHOWLIB *ANALOGY for the program code.
