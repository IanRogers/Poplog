NEWMASTER is a VED command for managing files in the Poplog master tree.

This was previously used as part of the software management system
at Sussex university.

It is still included in Poplog in case someone wishes to reinstate a
similar development system. That's probably unlikely!

==========

The HELP * NEWMASTER file states:


Using NEWMASTER is the recommended method for all additions and changes
made to the POPLOG master tree. The general format of the NEWMASTER
command is:

    <ENTER> newmaster [options]

With an appropriate choice of options, this command provides for five
separate functions to be performed on master files, namely:

    - the "get" function, which extracts files from the master tree;

    - the "edit" function, which adds a header to a new file or a
      revision note to an existing file;

    - the "install" function, which installs new files in the master
      tree or writes back changed copies;

    - the "delete" function, which removes a file from the master tree;

    - the "recover" function, which recovers previous versions of files.

The advantages of using NEWMASTER for these functions, rather than
editing master files directly, are that

    - it encourages a particular style of working common to all
      programmers;

    - it applies some (fairly rudimentary) consistency checking to cut
      down the possibility of accidental damage being done to the master
      files;

    - it keeps a comprehensive record of all additions and modifications
      to the masters, including "diff" records for program files, so
      that the history of the master tree can be traced.

It can also support multiple master versions.
