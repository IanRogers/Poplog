HELP VED_ALIAS                                     Aaron Sloman Oct 1994

ENTER alias <string>

Use of these facilities requires

    uses vedmail
    (E.g. in your $poplib/vedinit.p file)

The
    ENTER alias

command helps you find an email alias in your .mailrc file or someone
else's.

You give it a string, and it shows you every line of the file containing
either an alias or its expansion containing that string.

If you give it "*" as the string, it will show you every line of the file.

You can specify a file in which to look.

    <ENTER> alias <string>
    <ENTER> alias <file> <string>
    <ENTER> alias

If no argument is given it uses the text item to right of cursor as
the <string>.

If it finds a line containing the string it prints it on the status line,
with a menu, as follows.

You then have the following options:

    Press <RETURN> or Q if you want to stop,
    `1` if you want the alias inserted in the current VED buffer,
    `2` if you want the expansion inserted,
    `?` if you want a brief reminder of options,
    CTRL L to refresh the screen (in case of messages)
    <DEL> (or anything else) if you want to go on looking.

If you choose 1, or 2, it allows you to continue looking, in case you
want to insert more than one thing.

If there are long lines in the alias file they may not fit on status
line.

If no line containing the string is found in your file then it
attempts to do the equivalent of
    ENTER aliases <string>

which makes it look in the general aliases directory. See
