HELP ARRAYSET                                   David Young

LIB * ARRAYSET provides one procedure for setting the values in a region
of an array to a given constant.

arrayset(val, array, region)
        val is the value to store in every specified element of the
        array. It must me a suitable value - e.g. for a byte array val
        must be an integer in the range 0..255, for a float array val
        must be a real number, whilst for a full array val can be any
        Pop-11 object.

        array is an array of any number of dimensions.

        region is <false> or a list giving a boundslist-type
        specification of the part of array whose contents are to be set.
        (See REF * ARRAYS for how boundslists work.) If region is
        <false> then the boundslist of the array is used - i.e. every
        element of the array is set.

Any array can be given as an argument, though the routine will be
fastest if it is given a packed array of bytes (e.g. one created by
*newbytearray) or of single-precision floats (e.g. one created by
*newsfloatarray).  The array can have any number of dimensions and can be
offset in its arrayvector.
