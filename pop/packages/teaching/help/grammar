HELP GRAMMAR                                                  A. Sloman, 1980

The command LIB GRAMMAR invokes a program which enables you to type in
context-free grammars (with left and right recursion) and either build a
parser, using SETUP, or generate sentences at random, using GENERATE. For
further details of these facilities, see TEACH *GRAMMAR.

Additionally, there is a semantics package which extends LIB *GRAMMAR (see HELP
*FACETS for details).

There is a (slower) but more powerful package called LIB *TPARSE which finds
ALL parses where LIB *GRAMMAR will find only one - see HELP *TPARSE for
details of this.
