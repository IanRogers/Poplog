This   REF   file   lists   a   series   of   constants   supplied    by
INCLUDE * XPT_CONSTANTS. These give the values of various constants used
in the  Poplog  X  interface.  The  header  file  should  be  considered
read-only since many of the values defined are compiled into the  Poplog
image.

1  List of Constants
--------------------

XPT_CONSTANTS_LOADED -> true                          [include constant]
        This constant is set to true if the 'xpt_constants.ph' file  has
        been included.  The include  file will  ignore any  attempts  as
        recompilation while this constant is defined.
