## $poplocal/local/setup/Poplib/Poplogfiles
## Aaron Sloman 17 Sep 2000


This directory contains files that are used by the Poplog system
when it starts up.

The file init.p is always read

The file init.pl is read if you start up Poplog Prolog

The file init.ml is read if you start up Poplog ML

The file vedinit.p is read whenever VED starts up. If you
wish you can make it make use of two more files
    vedfiletypes.p
        For controlling how VED treats different types of files

When you are an expert user, you may wish to change many things in your
startup files.

These files can be copied to your ~/Poplib directory and edited

Then make sure your startup files call set $poplib to be ~/Poplib
