This package is a hybrid of programs and code produced by David Young at
the University of Sussex and Julian Clinton at ISL. It is made available
subject to the conditions of the Free Poplog system system as expressed
in the COPYRIGHT file in this directory.

For more information read the TEACH, HELP and REF files.

The install_neural command may be used to set up suitable symbolic
links if this package is located in $poplocal/local/neural

If it is located elsewhere, modify the install_neural command.

The file neural.p can be compiled no matter where this directory is
located. As long as the structure is unchanged, it will set up all
appropriate search lists, so that the libraries and documentation
are available.

You may need to compile C programs in neural/pop/c to create up to date
libraries for the basic neural net engines. To do this run either
compall or compall.gcc, if necessary after editing the file.

The version of Poplog-neural developed by ISL included a saved image
which provided a user interface for accessing library and documentation
files. This version assumes that the user is a proficient Pop-11
programmer and will access the documentation and libraries like any
other pop-11 package.
