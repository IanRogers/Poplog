HELP TREE_IDENTIFY                          Chris Mellish, November 1982

    lib tree_identify;

This library package implements a very simple "expert system" for
identifying trees. The program knows about all the trees native to the
British Isles, and identifies the tree in question by asking a number of
yes/no questions. The program is based on the use of a discrimination
net (see * DISCRIM). To use it, type:

    lib tree_identify;

The program will tell you what to do next.
