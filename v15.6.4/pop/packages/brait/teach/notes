    sensors MAYBE EXPERIMENT ONE, HAVE TWO SOURCES, LIGHT AND SOUND, AND SOUND
SENSORS. THEREFORE WILL SEE IT IGNORE ONE SOURCE AND MOVE AWAY FROM OTHER


NOT DONE V. WELL - ask jeremy about these sections.

NB - POP11 and XVED are parts of POPLOG
NB - DISTINGUISH BETWEEN POPLOG, XVED AND POP11
NB - XVED AND POP11 WRITTEN IN POPLOG ! argh.

NB - note on ;;;  comment header.

NB - weights as multipliers - intro, explain, and insert into vehicle1 2 3 and
4 sections

NB - make the user try his own examples of lists, vars etc. ? more hands-on

NB - intro to program ARGUMENTS is very bad!

NB - sections on variables and lists are badly incorporated into the flow of
the file.

ALWAYS REMEMBER -

NB - many different ways of explaining/doing things, TELL THEM THAT THIS IS
OUR WAY OF DOING IT. Remind them that there  are always other ways of doing
these things/ defining these things.

NB - always tell them what is coming up and what they have done previously.
