        Both have (require 'cl) added

CHANGES in version 2.3, released 01/09/99

1. Revised the documentation (see the file emacs in this directory).

2. Added the process communication commands (pop-send-define,
   pop-send-region, pop-send-buffer and pop-load-file) to the pop-help-mode
   keymap.  This is useful when reading TEACH files, which need to be
   compiled.

3. Added two new functions, pop-delchar-or-maybe-eof and pop-send-eof.  The
   comint-mode for XEmacs 19.15 is broken: killing the process leaves an
   extent after the process mark with closed ends.  As a result any final
   output from the process or from a subsequent process run in the same
   buffer appears in comint-input-face.  This doesn't catch all the ways the
   process can be killed without cleaning up the extent in the inferior pop
   buffer, but it fixes the most common problem.

4. Revised font-lock regular expressions to handle class, method and rule
   declarations.

5. Added two new functions, pop-insert-file-header and
   pop-add-revision-log-entry, for adding file headers and maintaining
   revision logs in the `standard' Sussex/Birmingham format.

6. Fixed the C-h pop-help-mode bindings for XEmacs (thanks to Lieven
   Marchand <mal@bewoner.dma.be>).


CHANGES in version 2.2, released 20/12/96

1. Fixed a bug in pop-end-of-sexp that caused it to go into an infinite loop
   when trying to find the end of an unclosed syntactic structure at the end
   of a buffer.  The bug was probably introduced when I optimised rjc's
   version.

2. Added a new variable to inferior-pop-mode to control initialisation of
   the inferior Poplog process.  If the variable inferior-pop-initialisation
   is nil, Emacs will assume that Poplog will do the necessary
   initialisation itself, e.g. in the user's init.p file.  The default value
   is t.  If you do set this to nil in your .emacs file, you *must* include
   the code in the file example-init.p for the Emacs/Poplog communication to
   work properly.

3. Fixed a bug that resulted in compilation output appearing at the wrong
   place in the inferior pop buffer (output appeared at point rather than at
   the process mark).

4. Revised pop-help-mode to cope with most of the new formatting and graphics
   characters which appear in the Poplog v15.5 help files.

5. Other minor fixes and revisions to pop-help-mode (thanks to Stephen Eglen
   <stephene@cogs.susx.ac.uk> for code and suggestions).


CHANGES in version 2.1, released 30/10/96

1. pop-mode now uses an up to date version of comint mode and as a result no
   longer breaks shell mode and other modes that depend on comint mode.

2. Much of the code that handles the inferior pop process has been rewritten
   in an attempt to eliminate problems caused by sending requests to pop
   when it is not a top level.  As a result, when compiling pop code, Emacs
   will lock up until pop is back at top level or generates some output.
   This can occasionally be a problem on a slow machine when compiling very
   large files from an Emacs buffer or compiling files that load a large
   number of libraries (compiling files by issuing commands to pop in the
   inferior pop buffer, e.g. typing "lib popvision;" at the prompt in the
   inferior pop buffer is not a problem).  To avoid this, set the variable
   inferior-pop-timeout to nil.  Note however that this disables all of
   pop-mode's pre-compilation checks and can result in text being dumped
   onto the stack if you try and compile something (or ask for help or
   completions) while your pop program is executing.

3. inferior-pop-mode now handles multiple windows onto the inferior pop
   buffer correctly: point no longer jumps to the end of the buffer when
   compiling pop code from emacs.

4. If the variable pop-compilation-messages is nil, inferior-pop-mode no
   longer writes the `;;; Compiling procedure from foo.p' comments in the
   inferior pop buffer (it writes a message in the minibuffer instead).

5. pop-mode and inferior pop mode buffers now add menus to the menubar (this
   is only available if you are running under X).

6. pop-mode now defines default regexps for font-lock.

7. pop-help-mode has been largely rewritten and the interaction model has
   changed.  By default pop-help-mode creates one buffer for each type of
   help file HELP, TEACH etc.  Making pop-help-always-create-buffer non nil
   creates a new buffer for each file and it is up to the user to manage the
   resulting buffers.

8. pop-help-mode now searches the REF indices if it can't find a help file
   for a keyword.

9. pop-help-mode now copes with `modern' Poplog help files: it (should)
   understand the new numeric syntax for file indices as well as the old `--'
   form.  It also removes the control characters that Ved uses for
   formatting before displaying the help buffer.

10.Like Ved, pop-help-mode now uses the Poplog searchlists to decide
   which directories to search for help files.  This is generally a Good
   Thing but a) it can be slow and b) it won't find help files which are not
   in the default searchlists and where the corresponding library hasn't been
   loaded.  If you don't like this behaviour, you can set
   pop-help-always-use-defaults to t and redefine the default searchlists in
   your .emacs to include the help directories for the libraries you use.

11.For XEmacs users the variable pop-use-pl1-comments is gone, since XEmacs
   can understand both comment styles.
