Transfers array data to and from disc with no heading information - the
arrayvector is just written raw, on its own. The array dimensions and
type must therefore be known for reading and an appropriate recipient
array created before the reading routine is called. Only one array can
be stored per file. This is mainly intended for writing sequences of
arrays to a directory where heading information is recorded in a single
file.

For more sophisticated utilities, see *sunrasterfile, *arrayfile,
*datafile and *datainout.

rawarrayfile(filename, arr) -> arr
        Reads data from the file named filename into the array arr. The
        file must contain sufficient data to fill arr. arr must have a
        byte-accessible arrayvector. Only the part of the arrayvector
        occupied by arr is written, and arr may be offset in its
        arrayvector. arr is returned for consistency with other similar
        routines.

arr -> rawarrayfile(filename)
        Creates a file named filename and writes data from the array arr
        to it. Restrictions on arr are as for the reading procedure. The
        file will contain an image of the arrayvector and no heading
        information at all.
