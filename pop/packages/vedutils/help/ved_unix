HELP VED_UNIX                                      Aaron Sloman Sep 1999

ENTER unix <command>
ENTER unix
    The first version runs the Unix <command> given
    The second version looks for a Unix command on the current
    line of the Ved buffer, and runs that. In either case, the
    output is read into a new Ved buffer.

This can be used to give a non-interactive Unix command. Any output from
that command will be read into a temporary VED buffer.

e.g.
    ENTER unix who

    ENTER unix ls -l

    ENTER unix mv <file1> <file2>

If the VED command is simply
    ENTER unix
then the unix command should be on the current line in Ved. E.g. Put the
cursor on the next line and do ENTER unix

    who

The arguments will be passed to the shell which is the current value of
the Unix environment variable $SHELL. If that has no value, it defaults
to /bin/csh

So if some of your normal shell commands do not work, make sure that
your $SHELL environment variable is set.

See also HELP * VED_BG
    For running a unix command in the background.
