1  Introduction
---------------

LIB * XT_WIDGETINFO provides  various  POP-11  functions  for  obtaining
miscellaneous information about how a  widget is displayed. The  library
LIB * FAST_XT_WIDGETINFO (loaded  automatically by  LIB * XT_WIDGETINFO)
provides a non-type checking interface to the same functions.

The  exact  structure  of  arguments  and  results  for  the   following
procedures is as discussed in REF * XPT_TYPES.

For more details see sections 2.5 and 2.6 of:

               X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface
                             X Window System
                         X Version 11, Release 4

2  LIB XT_WIDGETINFO
--------------------

XtIsRealized(widget) -> bool                                 [procedure]
        Returns true  if  the widget  widget  has been  realised,  false
        otherwise. Also see XtIsManaged and XtRealizeWidget. widget  can
        be a "normal" widget, a gadget, or an object.


XtScreen(widget) -> screenptr                                [procedure]
        Returns a pointer screenptr to the structure which describes the
        screen the widget  widget is on.  Also see XtScreenOfObject  and
        XtDisplay.


XtScreenOfObject(widget) -> screenptr                        [procedure]
        This function  is  identical to  XtScreen  unless widget  is  an
        object or a gadget. If widget  is an object or gadget, then  the
        XptScreenPtr returned refers to  the nearest ancestor of  widget
        that is not an object or gadget. Also see XtDisplayOfObject.


XtWindow(widget) -> window                                   [procedure]
        Returns the window window  of the widget  widget. If the  widget
        widget has not yet been realized window will be false. Also  see
        XtRealizeWidget, XtIsRealized-, and XtWindowToWidget.


XtWindowOfObject(widget) -> window                           [procedure]
        This function  is  identical to  XtWindow  unless widget  is  an
        object or gadget.  If widget  is an  object or  gadget then  the
        window returned refers to the window of the nearest ancestor  of
        widget that is not an object or gadget.


XtDisplayOfObject(widget) -> displayptr                      [procedure]
        This function  is identical  to XtDisplay  unless widget  is  an
        object or a gadget. If widget  is an object or gadget, then  the
        returned displayptr  refers to  the nearest  ancestor of  widget
        that is not an object  or gadget. See REF * XT_DISPLAY for  more
        information on displays. Also see XtScreenOfObject.


XtName(widget) -> string                                     [procedure]
        Returns the instance name of widget. Also see XtNameToWidget.


XtParent(widget) -> widget or false                          [procedure]
        Returns the parent of the specified  widget, or false if it  has
        none. Also see XptChildren.

3  LIB FAST_XT_WIDGETINFO
-------------------------

fast_XtIsRealized(widget) -> bool                            [procedure]
fast_XtScreen(widget) -> screenptr                           [procedure]
fast_XtScreenOfObject(widget) -> screenptr                   [procedure]
fast_XtWindow(widget) -> window                              [procedure]
fast_XtWindowOfObject(widget) -> window                      [procedure]
fast_XtDisplayOfObject(widget) -> displayptr                 [procedure]
fast_XtName(widget) -> string                                [procedure]
fast_XtParent(widget) -> widget or false                     [procedure]
        Non-checking versions of the procedures in  LIB * XT_WIDGETINFO.
        There operation is the same except that there is no checking for
        valid arguments.

        These procedures should only be used in fully debugged programs.
        See REF * XTOOLKIT  for  full details  of  the POPLOG  X  naming
        conventions for non-checking and checking procedures.

The following autoloadable functions may also be of use.


XptWidgetOfObject(widget1) -> widget2                        [procedure]
fast_XptWidgetOfObject(widget1) -> widget2                   [procedure]
        These procedures act like identfn unless widget1 is an object or
        a gadget. If  widget1 is and  object or gadget  then the  widget
        whose window the gadget is using will be returned. widget1  does
        not have to be realized.

        The procedure fast_XptWidgetOfObject does  not check that it  is
        given a widget, gadget, or object as its argument.
