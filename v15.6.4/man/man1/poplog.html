POPLOG
<br>
A multi-language interactive  software  development environment
</H1>
Note: "Poplog" is a trade mark of the University of Sussex.
<P>
<H2><B>
INTRODUCTION
</B></H2>
Much of this file is the style of a Unix man file. It is derived from
the man file distributed with Poplog. More detailed
information about Poplog can be found at
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html</a>
<P>
Poplog includes the incrementally compiled (not interpreted) core
language <I>Pop-11</I>, and various additional incrementally compiled
languages:
<I>Prolog</I>,
<I>Common Lisp</I>,
and
<I>Standard ML</I>. Various combinations of the languages, with
pre-compiled libraries, are provided as saved images. There are two
main modes of starting up one of these saved images, either by running
the language system, or by starting up the editor with the language
system enabled.
<P>
When starting up there are two types of shell commands, depending on
whether you have set up the Poplog environment variables or not.
If you have not, you can run the generic command "poplog" followed
by arguments specifying what exactly you want to run. If you have
set up the environment variables (as explained below) you can then
directly run the relevant executables, without running the "poplog"
command.
<P>
These two types of shell commands are now explained.

<P>
<H2><B>
SYNOPSIS (1)
</B></H2>
The following commands will work if the "poplog" startup script has been
installed at your site.
<UL>
<LI>  poplog pop11 [ +saved-image ... ] [  argument ... ] [  :command ]
<LI>  poplog xved [ filename ]
<LI>  poplog ved [ filename ]
<LI>  poplog prolog [ -|+saved-image ]
<LI>  poplog clisp [ -|+saved-image ]
<LI>  poplog pml [ -|+saved-image ]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><B>
SYNOPSIS(2)
</B></H2>
At some sites, e.g. Birmingham, there is a setup command that sets
environment variables, so that the following commands will work,
after "setup Poplog" at Birmingham or, in some other places,
<BR>
"source ...poplog/local/setup/bin/poplog", provided that you are
running csh or tcsh as your shell):
<UL>
<LI>  pop11 [ +saved-image ... ] [  argument ... ] [  :command ]
<LI>  xved [ filename ]
<LI>  ved [ filename ]
<LI>  prolog [ -|+saved-image ]
<LI>  clisp [ -|+saved-image ]
<LI>  pml [ -|+saved-image ]
</UL>

DESCRIPTION
</B></H2>
Poplog is an integrated, interactive, multi-language
software development environment. It used to be an expensive
commercial product (and by about 1992 total sales were
over 5 million dollars). Since July 1992 it has been freely available,
including system sources, from this site:
<P>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html</a>
<br>
which is partly mirrored at
<a href="http://www.poplog.org">http://www.poplog.org</a> a site
developed and mained by two freelance programmers who use Pop-11.
<P>
<P>
Poplog provides incremental compilers for several powerful
languages: POP-11, PROLOG, COMMON LISP and ML. A Poplog-based
incremental compiler for Scheme is also available.
<P>
Features include a powerful extensible text editor (Ved) which can
also be run as a multi-window editor (XVed). There are many hundreds of
online documentation files, tailored for use in Ved, or a programmable
editor such as Emacs. On Unix/Linux systems there is an interface to the
X window system (providing control panels and graphical capabilities).
There are also many demonstration and utility libraries including an
object oriented extension to Pop-11 known as Objectclass,
compiler-building tools, and mechanisms for dynamically
linking PASCAL, FORTRAN and C programs so that they can be
called from Poplog.
<P>
Since the early 1980s Poplog has included a sophisticated
interface, initially based on Sunview then replaced by the X
Window System, with facilities for dynamically linking in
widget sets (e.g. Motif or Poplog's own X widget set).
It can handle toolkit events, and supports remote access to Poplog
via X terminals, workstations or a PC running eXceed or linux.
It is possible to sit at a terminal supporting X, and interact with
Poplog graphical facilities running on a machine on another continent.
<P>
On systems that include Motif the default Poplog interface tools use
Motif "widgets", e.g. for menus and file browsers. An alternative user
interface, developed in Birmingham, which does not depend on Motif is
available from the free poplog site:
<BR>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib.tar.gz">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rclib.tar.gz</a>
<BR>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rcmenu.tar.gz">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/rcmenu.tar.gz</a>
(At Birmingham these are pre-installed by default.) For some examples of
what the graphical tools can do see
    <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/figs/rclib/</a>
<P>
The use of interface tools based on the X window system makes
it possible for a user in one building sitting at
a workstation, an X terminal or a PC, to interact with
sophisticated programs on a powerful Unix or VMS machine in
another building, as if using a very powerful graphical
workstation on one's desk. Poplog supported such interaction
long before the world wide web.
<P>
<I>Poplog</I> includes the source code for a large number of
library packages, which are usually programs that the user
can read, copy and modify. These programs are written in
Pop-11, Prolog, Lisp and standard ML. The widest variety of
utilities and demonstration programs is in Pop-11.
<P>
These include many teaching libraries for students of Artificial
Intelligence (and more general programming).
<P>
<H2><B>
HOW IT WORKS
</B></H2>
At the heart of <I>Poplog</I> is the <I>Poplog Virtual Machine</I>. The
Poplog compilers translate program text from the source
language (e.g. from Pop-11, Prolog, Lisp, ML or a user-defined
language) into a sequence of Poplog Virtual Machine
(VM) instructions, that are in turn compiled into real
machine code instructions for the host machine. Since the compiler is
part of the run time system, new procedures can be compiled and added to
the system at any time, or old ones recompiled (after which space
occupied by the old machine code instructions will be reclaimed by the
Poplog garbage collector).
<P>
This "incremental compilation" system provides the programmer
with a suitable environment for rapid-prototyping,
whilst also ensuring efficient code execution. The provision
of the Poplog Virtual Machine as a target for compilers simplifies
porting of Poplog languages, and programs written
using them, to new machines.
<P>
Poplog is available on a variety of Unix and VMS platforms,
including Sun, Hewlett Packard, Silicon Graphics and Digital
Alpha. A version for a PC running Linux or Solaris is also
available. Additional Unix/Linux versions may become available at the
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/freepoplog.html">Free Poplog
site</a>.
<P>
There is also a version without graphics and with some restricted
facilities for a PC running NT, which also works on windows95/98,
also accessible at the Free Poplog site.
<P>
In addition there is a growing collection of libraries and teaching
documentation and software for AI and programming.
<P>
The <I> Poplog Virtual Machine </I> provides support for a large
variety of datatypes, including linked lists, arrays,
strings, integers, `big' integers, floating point numbers,
rational numbers, and complex numbers. The Objectclass
extension supports Object Oriented proramming with inheritance. Users
can define new datatypes. Poplog variables and
constants can either be dynamically or lexically scoped, and
are weakly typed. It provides trace and debugging facilities
supporting rapid prototyping of complex software.
<P>
Poplog has a very efficient storage manager, using a
mark-and-sweep copying garbage collector, which is automatically
replaced by a non-copying algorithm when there is not enough
space for copying.
<P>
Thus users do not need to worry about
reclaiming inaccessible data areas. Pop-11 processes start
from about two megabytes in size (including the Pop-11
compiler, the editor VED, and many utilities). Prolog, Lisp or
ML require more, but all start in less than about three
megabytes. Poplog processes can grow as required, to whatever size the
machine and the operating system will allow.
<P>
Poplog is far too complex to describe fully in a manual page
entry. This document serves only as a pointer to the large
amount of on-line documentation that is available within the
Poplog environment. More information about Poplog is available
at this location:
<P>
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html</a>
<P>

<H2><B>
EXTENSIONS AVAILABLE
</B></H2>
There are several extensions to Poplog available at the Free Poplog site
including tools for building graphical interfaces, a powerful collection
of programs for analysing images and implementing neural nets, along
with teaching documentation, a toolkit for exploring agent
architectures, an expert system shell, and the Pop-11 teaching files and
program libraries developed at the Universities of Sussex and
Birmingham. There are several companies which sell software implemented
in Pop-11 or other Poplog languages, most notably the award winning
Clementine Data Mining System developed by
<a href="http://www.isl.co.uk">Integral Solutions Ltd,</a>
bought by SPSS in 1998.
<P>

<H2><B>
THE LANGUAGE Pop-11
</B></H2>
The core language of Poplog is Pop-11. Pop-11 combines the
features found in other AI languages like Lisp with a syntax
that is similar in form to Pascal or C. Pop-11 code is easy
to read, and includes many familiar control structures. For
example, the following Pop-11 code prints the word "hello"
out five times, including an end of line comment starting ";;;":
<PRE>

    ;;; print hello out five times
    repeat 5 times

        "hello" =>

    endrepeat;

</PRE>
Pop-11 also includes a high level pattern-based syntax for list
manipulation. For instance the following declares two variables
<I>middle</I> and <I>list</I>, asks the user to type in a line of words
to be made into a list of words and assigned to <I>list</I>, then
if the user's list starts with "I" and ends with "you" prints out
a new list containing the middle bit, between "We" and "each other".
<PRE>

    ;;; declare two variables
    vars middle, list;

    ;;; assign a list of words typed by user to list
    readline() -> list;

    ;;; Check whether to respond
    if list matches [I ??middle you] then
        [We ^^middle each other] =>
    endif;

</PRE>

So if the user types in
<P>
<PRE>
    I like talking to you
</PRE>
<P>
The program will respond
<PRE>

    ** [We like talking to each other]

</PRE>

<P>
Because the syntax of Pop-11 is very readable, it is relatively easy
to learn, and has been found to be very effective as a teaching tool,
for beginners, whether for general programming or for AI and Cognitive
Science students. However, experienced Pop-11 programmers can also make
use of rich syntactic structures, and the large numbers of utilities, to
write very complex and diverse packages, such as Poplog itself, which is
mostly implemented in Pop-11.
<P>
Since the editor, the compiler and the debugging tools are
all part of the same environment, programmers are saved from
the laborious task of switching between editors and compilers, waiting
for error messages from the compilers, and
switching back to the editor again.
<P>
A lot more information about Pop-11 is available in online
documentation files accessible when running Poplog and also
at the Free Poplog directory, including the Pop-11 primer, at
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/primer/</a>
<P>
Another source of information is at this web site:
<a href="http://www.poplog.org">http://www.poplog.org</a>
Files at that site and at the Free Poplog site contain
pointers to additional sites with information about Poplog and Pop-11.
<P>
<H2><B>
COMMANDS
</B></H2>
Commands to run the poplog languages or packages based on
them, come in two formats, either preceded by the word "poplog" or
not. In the first format, e.g.
<P>
<PRE>
    poplog pop11
</PRE>
<P>
<PRE>
    poplog xved myfile.p
</PRE>
<P>
"poplog" invokes a shell script which sets up a collection
of environment variables, then runs the appropriate Poplog
program, passing on the arguments.
<P>
In the second format, without the word "poplog", users can
invoke the Poplog programs directly, provided they have
already set up the environment variables, e.g. in the user's
.login file. This will be slightly faster than the first
format, as well as being less verbose.
<P>
The first format is
more suitable for the occasional user, though it depends on
the poplog shell script being in a directory included in the
user's $PATH. If this appears not to be available at your
site, contact your system administrator, who should read
this man file.
<P>
At Birmingham the second format is made available by means
of the command:
<PRE>

    setup Poplog

</PRE>
in the user's .login file. Different startup conventions
will be available at different sites.
<P>
An alternative way to make the system work in the second
format is to put a set of commands in your .login file, e.g.
something like the following, depending on where the Poplog
system and the poplog local directories are located on your
machine:
<PRE>

    setenv usepop /usr/local/poplog/v15.53

    setenv poplocal /usr/local/poplog/

    setenv local $poplocal/local

    source $usepop/pop/com/poplog

    setenv poplib ~/poplib
</PRE>

<P>
If your login shell is bash, or ksh, or sh, then you will need the
following instead in your .profile file:
<PRE>

    usepop=/usr/local/poplog/v15.53

    poplocal=/usr/local/poplog/

    local=$poplocal/local

    export usepop poplocal local

    . $usepop/pop/com/poplog.sh

    poplib=$HOME/poplib

    export poplib

</PRE>

<P>
The last command can be changed to specify the location
where you would like to install your personal poplog startup
files, init.p, vedinit.p, init.pl, init.lsp, init.ml and
other pop-11 files.
<P>
<H2><B>
SUMMARIES OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
</B></H2>
In the sections below, the second format is given. Each
example can be preceded with the word "poplog" to run in the
first format if the poplog startup shell script has been
installed in one of your local executable directories on
your $PATH search list.
<P>
<H3><B>
pop11
</B></H3>
Loads the default Poplog system, with only the Pop-11
compiler.
<P>
<H3><B>
ved
</B></H3>
First loads the default Poplog system, with the Pop-11
compiler, and then loads the Poplog editor, Ved. This
command can take one argument (a filename) that is
passed to Ved as the name of the initial file to edit.
<P>
<H3><B>
xved
</B></H3>
As above, but starts the multi-window version of Ved. It can also be
given a file name as argument, to cause it to start with that file's
contents in the editor buffer.
<P>
The following two formats are equivalent:
<P>
<H3><B>
prolog,
<BR>
pop11 +prolog
</B></H3>
First loads the default Poplog system, with the Pop-11
compiler, and then starts the Prolog compiler (provided
pre-compiled within a saved image).
<P>
<H3><B>
clisp
<BR>
pop11 +lisp
</B></H3>
First loads the default Poplog system, with the Pop-11
compiler, and then starts the Common Lisp compiler
(provided as a saved image).
<P>
<H3><B>
pml,
<BR>
pop11 +pml
</B></H3>
First loads the default Poplog system, with the Pop-11
compiler, and then starts the Standard ML compiler.
<P>
It is possible to have additional saved images that start up XVed with
two of the language compilers installed. For instance in Birmingham
there is a saved image that allows the following

<H3><B>
pop11 +xvedpro
</B></H3>
First loads the default Poplog system, with the Pop-11
compiler, and then loads a saved image with prolog precompiled and then
starts up the multi-window editor Xved. If given an additional argument
which is the name of a file, it will read that file into Xved.
<P>
Sample shell scripts for building saved images can be found in the
directory
<I>
$usepop/pop/com
</I>
and also in this directory
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/image-scripts">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/image-scripts</a>
<P>
<H2><B>
OPTIONS
</B></H2>
For more information on Poplog parameter passing, see the
Poplog help file HELP PARAMETERS, or the more detailed
specification in REF SYSTEM. The following are among the
options which may be combined with the pop11 command to
affect the way it starts up.
<P>
<H3><B>
+saved-image ...
</B></H3>
Loads the Poplog environment and then looks for the
specified Poplog saved image. Poplog will search the
directories specified in $popsavepath, and in the
current directory. The suffix .psv is added to the
filename if no suffix is specified. Several incremental
saved images can be loaded using the "+saved-image"
form. Additional arguments specified using the "-" flag
will be passed into the Poplog environment. By default,
such arguments are ignored, although the programmer may
wish to define interpretations for them. If this option
is given the :command option (described below) must be omitted. For more
information about saved images and parameter options, see REFSYSTEM.
<P>
<H3><B>
:command
</B></H3>
Loads the Poplog environment, and then executes the
Pop-11 instruction command. E.g. this will cause pop-11 to start up
print the square root of 99, then exit
<PRE>

    pop11 ":sqrt(99)=>"
</PRE>
<P>
<H3><B>
ved filename
</B></H3>
Loads the Poplog environment, sets up the editor (Ved),
and reads filename into a ved buffer, ready for editing.
<P>
<H3><B>
xved filename
</B></H3>
As above, but starts the multi-window version of the
editor XVed.
<P>
<H3><B>
%x
</B></H3>
If this optional parameter is provided, it causes Pop-11, or Prolog, or
Lisp or Pml to start up with a control panel providing menu options, and
causes the editor to invoke the X window version with multiple windows.
<P>
<H2><B>
Other commands that may be available include:
</B></H2>
<H3><B>
eliza
</B></H3>
loads and runs the demo program Eliza (if available).
<P>
<H2><B>
POPLOG INITIALIZATION
</B></H2>
Poplog uses environent variables to store information about
the location of files, defaults and documentation. These
variables are usually initialized using a shell script. For
details see your local system administrator or the Poplog
files that may be viewed in Ved by giving these commands (followed by
the Page Down key to read on):
<PRE>

    poplog help initial
    poplog help initial.ex
    poplog ref system

</PRE>

The first file explains how to use initialization files,
such as init.p, vedinit.p, init.pl, init.lsp,
and init.ml. Default scripts reside in the pop/com directory
of the Poplog tree. These scripts are usually executed as
part of the user's .login script. There may be additional
"local" startup scripts at your site, e.g. in
<I>
$poplocal/local/com/poplog
</I>
and
<I>
$poplocal/local/com/popenv
</I>
<P>
As explained above, a typical login script sourced from the
<I>.login</I> directory of a user whose login shell is <B>csh</B> or
<B>tcsh</B> might contain the following:
<P>
<PRE>
    setenv usepop /usr/local/poplog.v15.53 (or whatever)

    source $usepop/pop/com/poplog
</PRE>
It might also set the environment variable $poplib, for the directory
containing the user's startup files (e.g. init.p, vedinit.p) and
possibly also the variable $poplocal, which defines where the local
extensions to poplog are kept. For a user of <B>bash</B>,
<B>ksh</B> or <B>sh</B> alternative commands, given above, could be
used in the .profile file.
<P>
<H2><B>
LOCAL ARRANGEMENTS
</B></H2>
(This section may need to be re-written for your site.)
<P>
At Birmingham, Poplog is available on the school of Computer
Science Sun network, and also on the Digital (Compaq) Alpha
servers run by the central Information Service. In the
School of Computer science Poplog users should include, in
their .login files the line
<P>
<PRE>
    setup Poplog
</PRE>
<P>
Users of the Alpha Servers at Birmingham (e.g. isdugp, isdugi) should
include in their .profile files the command
<P>
<PRE>
    . /bham/global/poplogin.ksh
</PRE>
<P>
Poplog initialization often prints out a message giving the
Poplog version, and adds the Poplog executables to the users
PATH.
<P>
Sites elsewhere wishing to obtain the facilities used at
Birmingham can fetch various packages from the Free Poplog
site, e.g.
<a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/bhamteach.tar.gz">http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/bhamteach.tar.gz</a>
and other things in the same directory.
<P>
For more information, contact your system administrator, or
see the User Guide, or the online information in
<PRE>

    poplog help initial
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><B>
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
</B></H2>
<H3><B>
$usepop
</B></H3>
Holds the path to the root of the Poplog directory
tree.
<P>
<H3><B>
$poplocal
</B></H3>
Holds the path to the root of the Poplog local tree.
This is used to store site-specific libraries and documentation. Since
by convention all the local libraries
are in a subdirectory called local/ in the $poplocal/
directory, you may find it convenient to define an
environment variable called $local, equivalent to
$poplocal/local.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popcom
</B></H3>
Set to $usepop/pop/com. This directory holds several
csh(1) scripts for making default saved images, and
setting up the poplog environment.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popsrc
</B></H3>
<BR>
Set to $usepop/pop/src. This directory contains the
sources for the Poplog environment, if provided. The
sources may be in object file form.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popsys
</B></H3>
Set to $usepop/pop/pop. Contains the Poplog executable
commands, including pop11, prolog, pml, clisp.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popautolib, $poplocalauto
</B></H3>
Set to $usepop/pop/lib/auto and $poplocal/local/auto
respectively. These are used for autoloadable libraries.
The compiler searches these directories
when it is trying to evaluate an undefined identifier.
If a file is found with the same name as the identifier (with '.p'
as suffix), it is compiled. This enables the Poplog environment to be
invisibly extended, whilst conserving memory usage for those who do not
use the utility named by the identifier.
<P>
<H3><B>
$poplocalbin
</B></H3>
Directory containing local saved images.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popliblib, $popdatalib, $poppwmlib, $popsunlib, $popvedlib
</B></H3>
Set to directories containing library packages for
Pop-11, Pwm, Sun consoles and Ved.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popsavelib
</B></H3>
Set to $usepop/pop/psv. This directory contains some
standard saved images, including the Prolog, Lisp and
ML saved images.
<P>
<H3><B>
$popsavepath
</B></H3>
Lists of directories containing Poplog saved images.
Users may add paths to directories containing their own
saved images. By default, this is set to
<B>$poplib:$poplocalbin:$popsavelib.</B>
<P>
<H3><B>
$poplib
</B></H3>
User definable. Holds the path to the user's own
library directory. It is possible for two or more users
to share such a directory if they wish. Poplog will
look in this directory for saved images and initialization files (see
below).
<P>
<H3><B>
$pop_{name}
</B></H3>
When Poplog is executed, it checks the name of the command that it was
executed by (ie. argv[0]). If this
command was not "pop11", Poplog looks for an environment variable
starting with "pop_" and ending with
argv[0]. If such a variable exists, Poplog treats the
contents of the variable as the arguments to Poplog.
This is a convenient way of making new commands. To
make a command myved, which loads pop11 with the saved
image called myved.psv, make a symbolic link between
$popsys/pop11 and myved, and set the environment variable
pop_myved to "+myved":
<PRE>

    ln -s $popsys/pop11 myved

    setenv pop_myved +myved

</PRE>
<P>
<H2><B>
FILES
</B></H2>
<UL>
<LI>
<B>
$poplib/init.p
</B>
<BR>
After Poplog is loaded, the Pop-11 code in this file is
compiled. Users can use this file to define useful
procedures and variables to tailor the Poplog environment to their own
tastes, e.g. whether the variable
pop_debugging is true or false by default.
<P>
<LI>
<B>
$poplib/vedinit.p
</B>
<BR>
This Pop-11 file is compiled when the Ved editor is
evoked. Users can write programs to tailor the operation of Ved, so
that for example it behaves sensibly
when different terminals are being used. This file can
also be used to define extra VED <ENTER> commands, or
to modify the default actions that Ved takes when a new
file is edited (see HELP VEDFILETYPES,
HELP VEDVEDDEFAULTS).
<P>
<LI>
<B>
$poplib/init.pl
</B>
<BR>
A file containing PROLOG code that is compiled when
