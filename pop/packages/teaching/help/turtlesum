SUMMARY OF TURTLE COMMANDS
--------------------------

Here's a reminder of the main turtle procedures.

 JUMP DRAW: both take a number, positive or negative, as
    argument.
 NEWPICTURE: takes two arguments, the width and height
    required.  (Not used with LIB VTURTLE)
 JUMPTO DRAWTO: both take two arguments, representing a location.
 JUMPBY DRAWBY: both take two arguments, representing amounts
    to move along and up.
 DISPLAY: prints out the current picture.
 TURN: takes a number (positive or negative) indicating how many
    degrees the turtle should turn: nti-clockwise if the number
    is positive, clockwise otherwise.
    E.g. TURN(90)
    alters the heading for the next DRAW or JUMP command as
    if the turtle had turned left 90 degrees.
 TURNTO: takes two numbers and makes the turtle change its
    heading. E.g. TURNTO(10,15); makes the turtle face in
    the direction of the point with co-ordinates 10 and 15.
    So DRAW(5); will then move it to that point.

 XPOSITION YPOSITION HEADING PAINT: Represent the state
    of the turtle.      Not in LIB VTURTLE;

 PICTURE(X,Y):  gives the contents of the picture at
    location X,Y.

 TURTLE: This procedure creates a new picture, using the
    standard size, or the size you last gave NEWPICTURE.
    The turtle is placed in the bottom left hand
    corner, facing right (i.e. position 1,1 and
    heading 0)
    In the case of LIB VTURTLE, the turtle is in the top left hand corner,
    and size is not relevant.
 TURTLE_PR: Print out the value of its argument, just like pr (or => ) but
    on the turtle picture, in the direction the turtle is facing. Use it for
    labels etc - it will write vertically and diagonally if desired.
    Not in LIB VTURTLE.
