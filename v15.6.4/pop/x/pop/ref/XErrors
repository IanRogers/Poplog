XSetIOErrorHandler(p)                                        [procedure]
        This procedure  sets  the  system error  handler  to  the  given
        procedure p. The system error handler is called by the  Poplog X
        Windows library if any  sort of system  call error occurs,  e.g.
        the connection to the server was  lost. This is assumed to  be a
        fatal condition, i.e., the called routine should not return.  If
        p is false,  the default  error handler is  restored. The  error
        handler p is passed a single argument - the display structure of
        the current X Windows server, it shoudl return an INT.


XSetErrorHandler(p)                                          [procedure]
        The program's supplied  error handler  p will be  called by  the
        library whenever an error event is received. This is not assumed
        to be  a  fatal  condition,  i.e., it  is  acceptable  for  this
        procedure to  return.  However,  the error  handler  should  NOT
        perform any operations (directly or indirectly) on the  Display.
        When an error occurs,  the handler p is  called, and passed  two
        arguments,  the  current  display   structure,  and  an   XEvent
        structure XErrorEvent, it should return an int


XGetErrorText(DspPtr,int1,string,int2)                       [procedure]
        This procedure  returns  a  string  describing  the  error  code
        specified by int1.


XGetErrorDatabaseText(DspPtr,string1,string2,string3,        [procedure]
                        CharPtr,int)
XDisplayName(string) -> CharPtr                              [procedure]
XSetAfterFunction(DspPtr,p)                                  [procedure]
XSynchronize(DspPtr,int)                                     [procedure]
        These procedures shadow the equivalent C functions.
