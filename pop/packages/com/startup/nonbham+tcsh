If your login shell is tcsh or csh, and you do not have the Birmingham
extensions to Poplog, then

    define $usepop as an environment variable corresponding to where
    you installed the top poplog directory, referred to as ROOTDIR
    below. The default for ROOTDIR is
       /usr/local/poplog

    Do this with the appropriate directory as ROOTDIR:

        setenv usepop ROOTDIR/v15.53

    then
        source $usepop/pop/com/poplog
        rehash


    You can put those commands into your .login file so that they are
    automatically run whenever you log in or start a new login shell.

    The 'rehash' command is not needed if the above commands are in your
    .login file.

For more information see

which should have been installed in poplog as

    $usepop/man/man1/userguide.html
