LIB *ARRAY_MXMN provides one procedure for finding the maximum and
minimum values in a region of an array.

array_mxmn(ARRAY, REGION) -> (MX, MN)
        ARRAY is an array containing numbers. REGION is false or a list
        giving a boundslist-type specification of a part of the array.
        (See REF * ARRAYS for how boundslists work.) If REGION is false
        then the boundslist of the array is used - i.e. the whole of the
        array is searched.
            Two results are returned: MX is the largest value in the
        region and MN the smallest.

Any array can be given as an argument, though the routine will be
fastest if it is given a packed array of bytes (e.g. one created by
*newbytearray) or of single-precision floats (e.g. one created by
*newsfloatarray).  The array can have any number of dimensions and can be
offset in its arrayvector.

If ARRAY is a standard full array, then the region specified must only
contain numbers.
