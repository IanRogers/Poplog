-- Overview -----------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever been looking at a file and wanted to compare it with
the version in the master library, and then had to do some tedious
searching to find the master version?

The answer is ved_master

It can get either the masters in $popmaster or, if given the "-f"
flag the frozen masters in $frozmaster.

If the current file is a program file it uses its header to find where
to look in the masters. If the current file is a documentation file it
uses the footer to find where to look. (Some old documentation files
lack footers, and then it will fail.)

ved_master can be used when the current file is one of:

    a local file that corresponds to a master file,

    a currently installed file (i.e. in the $usepop/pop... tree

    a private copy of a file that is in the masters

    a file in the masters or frozen masters (which you may wish to
        compare with a different version).


-- Form of invocation -------------------------------------------------

<ENTER> master
<ENTER> master [ <flags> ] [ <system> ]

    <flags>

        if present, must start with "-" and can contain any of
        d, q, or f, in any order, with no spaces.

        If `d` is present, then run ved_diff on the original and the
            new file

        If `q` is present, then quit the present file.

        If `f` is present, then look in the frozen masters

    <system>
        if present, can be any of
            unix, vms, bsd, sysv
        or any of the directory names in $popmaster, e.g.

            C.all, C.vms, S.mips, S.symmetry


If <system> is not specified, then it tries, in order:
            C.all, C.unix, C.bsd

since local library files, if they have master versions, will have them
in one of these directories.


-- Example forms of use -----------------------------------------------

<ENTER> master -fd
    Gets the frozen master version of the current file (which could be a
    local version e.g. lib pophost, a curently installed version, the
    private copy you have been working on, etc.) It runs ved_diff to
    compare the orignal with the frozen master.

    If argument is -f then it gets the frozen masters.

<ENTER> master -fd vms
<ENTER> master -fd C.vms
    As before, but looks only in the C.vms directory

<ENTER> master -q C.bsd
    Looks in the C.bsd master directory, and if the corresponding file
    is found there, quits the current file and reads in the master one.

<ENTER> master -d  sysv
    Gets the C.systemv version in the masters if it exists, and then
    runs ved_diff

<ENTER> master [ -f ] unix
    Gets the C.unix version if it exists, but tries C.bsd. Looks in the
    frozen masters if -f is present.


-- Trying ved_master on a local library file --------------------------

To try it out
    SHOWLIB * VED_PRINT (local file)

    <ENTER> master
        To find the master version

    <ENTER> master vms
        To see the VMS version

    <ENTER> master sysv
        To see the bobcat version

    <ENTER> master -f vms
        To see the VMS version in the frozen masters


or try:

    HELP * NEWS     (current public file)
    <ENTER> master -f

etc.
