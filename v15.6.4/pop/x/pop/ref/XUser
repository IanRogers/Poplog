This REF  file  describes some  additional  XEvent structures  that  are
defined in  LIB * XUser. Please  refer to  REF * XEvents for  a  general
description of XEvent structures.

XKeyEvent                                                      [typedef]
        Refer to  REF *  XEvents  for a  general description  of  XEvent
        structures.

            typedef struct {
                int type;
                unsigned long serial;
                Bool send_event;
                Display *display;
                Window window;
                Window root;
                Window subwindow;
                Time time;
                int x, y;
                int x_root, y_root;
                unsigned int state;
                unsigned int keycode;
                Bool same_screen;
            } XKeyEvent;

        type is the  type of  event; serial is  the number  of the  last
        request processed  by the  server; send_event  is true  if  this
        event is  the result  of  a SendEvent  request; display  is  the
        display that the event was read from; window is the event window
        it is reported  relative to; root  is the root  window that  the
        event occured in; subwindow is a child window; time is  measured
        in milliseconds; x and y are the x,y coordinates of the  pointer
        in the  event  window; x_root  and  y_root are  the  coordintaes
        relative to the  root window;  state is  a key  or button  mask;
        keycode provides details of the event; same_screen is a flag.


XMappingEvent                                                  [typedef]
        Refer to  REF *  XEvents  for a  general description  of  XEvent
        structures.

            typedef struct {
                int type;
                unsigned long serial;
                Bool send_event;
                Display *display;
                Window window;
                int request;
                int first_keycode;
                int count;
            } XMappingEvent;

        type, serial,  send_event,  and  display are  as  described  for
        XKeyEvent  above;  window  is  not  used;  request  is  one   of
        MappingModifier,     MappingKeyboard     or      MappingPointer;
        first_keycode is the first keycode in the mapping; count defines
        the range of change with respect to the first_keycode.
