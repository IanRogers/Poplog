AFTER INSTALLATION CHECK OUT POPLOG

If you are using one of tcsh or csh as your shell
    Type:
        rehash
    in order to get your command index updated.
    If your shell is bash you need not give the rehash command.


Check that pop11 starts up, by giving this command:

   poplog pop11

If it starts up, try this:
    99*9 =>

Then to leave pop11,type either CTRL D, or
    bye

Then check out Xved as set up in Birmingham:
   poplog xved

If it starts up OK, check that Ved works, e.g.
    ENTER teach eliza

See what the various function keys do. See
    ENTER teach quickved

For a fairly comprehensive summary see:
    ENTER teach vednotes

To exit do
    ENTER bye

Always exit xved before logging out or leaving the X window system.
=======================================================================

Test eliza:

First run pop11
    poplog pop11

Then when you get the colon prompt type:

    eliza();

Type what you like, ending each sentence with RETURN. Finish with
    bye

That will take you back to Pop-11's colon prompt. Exit Pop-11
with another
    bye

or CTRL-D
