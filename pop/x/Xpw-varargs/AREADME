$usepop/pop/x/Xpw-varargs/AREADME

Acting on advice from Andreas Eder and Waldek Hebisch, I have converted
the source code for Xpw to use the new 'stdargs' format instead of the
old 'varargs' format which is being phased out.

This directory contains the old files which were replaced by new
versions
    CallMethod.c
    Methods.h
    MethodsP.h

If the 'stdargs' option does not work on some version of poplog these
files can simply be moved or copied into the Xpw directory and this
script run:

    $usepop/pop/com/mkXpw
