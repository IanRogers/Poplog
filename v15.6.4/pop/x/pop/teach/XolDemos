TEACH *XolDemos                             Jonathan Meyer, Jan 1990

Included in Poplog 14 is a set of demonstration programs written in
Pop-11 for the OpenLook widgetset. The demonstration programs serve
several purposes. The programs are:

    o   a way of finding what widgets are in OpenLook
    o   an illustration of programming with the X Toolkit in Pop-11
    o   examples of how to use each of the OpenLook widgets
    o   code that you might find useful in your applications

Note that the demonstrations have very little functionality associated
with them - most of the widgets will 'work', but just don't do very much
when you click/select/drag on them.

Read HELP *OPENLOOK to learn how to start using OpenLook widgets. TEACH
*OPENLOOK is a tutorial showing you how to create a simple control
panel.

To run the demos, you need to execute:

    lib XolDemos

This library first adds the X demo directory to your search path, and
then loads LIB *XolDemoUtils, which loads all of the OpenLook widgets
and defines a few useful procedures, including the one to manage
the demo menu. This will take some time to load, since Poplog has to
dynamically link in OpenLook widgets. After loading XolDemoUtils, each
of the Xol demos is loaded in turn. When they have finished loading, a
menu will appear on your display. The following menu choices are
available on the Demo Menu:

    Widget Sampler
    Text Controls
    Basic Controls

Widget Sampler
--------------

Selecting the widget sampler demo will create a window displaying
each of the basic widgets in OpenLook. Several additional
windows appear as the result of selecting buttons in the main
sampler window. Many of the buttons and sliders will print messages when
they are selected. Others will change their appearance, or
configuration.

The Widget Sampler is in LIB *XolSamplerDemo. It is very similar to the
C sampler provided with OpenWindows, so comparison of the code should
prove informative.

Text Controls
-------------

This demo produces a window showing the 4 basic types of textual
controls in OpenLook: StaticText, TextEdit, TextField and ScrollingList.
The code for this demo is in LIB *XolTextDemo.

Basic Controls
--------------

This demo produces a window displaying one of each of the basic
components in the OpenLook widgetset: Buttons, OblongButtons,
RectButtongs, CheckBoxes, Arrows, AbbrevMenuButtons, MenuButtons,
Scrollbars and Sliders. You can interact with the components, although
the demo does not define any actions to perform when you do activate
buttons etc. The code for this demo is in LIB *XolControlsDemo.
