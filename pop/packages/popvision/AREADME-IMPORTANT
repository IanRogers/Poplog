THIS PACKAGE WAS DEVELOPED BY DAVID YOUNG ON SUNS RUNNING SOLARIS.

AFTER IT WAS INSTALLED ON LINUX SOME PROBLEMS WERE FOUND
IN THE MOST RECENTLY ADDDED LIBRARIES:

    lib/arrpack.p
    lib/lapack.p
    lib/lapop.p

described in
    help/arrpack
    help/lapack
    help/lapop

It turned out that there were several problems,

o a bug which prevented externally loaded libraries working properly
  in some cases. The bug was fixed by altering the file
    $popsrc/extern_symbols.p

o bugs in the ways in which external procedures returning single floats
  were handled.

o It has also been found necessary (29 Mar 2006) to remove the
    '-lm' parameters from some of the exload commands in
    libraries
     straight_hough.p
     canny.p
     float_arrayprocs.p
     lapack.p

    This seemed to be needed to prevent the following warning in recent
    versions of linux
 ;;; Warning: can't open shared object /usr/lib/libm.so (Inappropriate ioctl for
 ;;;     device)

    Users who encounter problems compiling some of the popvision
    libraries may be able to fix the problems by altering the parameters
    used for dynamic loading of external libraries.

If you are using a version of linux poplog that was built prior to

    Thu Jan  6 17:08:06 GMT 2005

the new facilities in popvision will not work for you.

If you are an expert you can fetch the latest core of poplog
from here and install it:

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/new/linux-poplog.tar.gz

Alternatively you can fetch the whole Birmingham Linux Poplog
package

    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/bham-linux-poplog.tar.gz

rebuilt on 6 Jan 2005, which includes the latest version of
popvision.tar.gz

If you don't have blas and lapack on your machine, and wish to use the
new mathematical libraries, you can fetch and install the following
from:
     http://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists/ac/ready/

The following packages were installed on the two machines I used to test
the new facilities:

on an AMD athlon based machine, installed in this order:

     libg2c-3.4.3-2.athlon.rpm

     blas-3.0-29.athlon.rpm

     lapack-3.0-29.athlon.rpm

These two seem to be  optional:
     blas-devel-3.0-29.athlon.rpm
     lapack-devel-3.0-29.athlon.rpm

and on a pentium based machine (Dell D600 laptop), the following
installed in this order:

     libg2c-3.4.3-2.i686.rpm

     blas-3.0-29.i686.rpm

     lapack-3.0-29.i686.rpm

These two seem to be optional:
     blas-devel-3.0-29.i686.rpm
     lapack-devel-3.0-29.i686.rpm

Those rpm files were all obtained from the PLD distribution libraries
     http://ftp.pld.org.pl/dists/ac/ready/
(for which many thanks to the PLD team). There are also rpm packages
for linux different architecturs.

    uses popvision, lapack;
