XSetWindowAttributes                                           [typedef]
        This data structure is used for setting window attributes.

            typedef struct {
                Pixmap background_pixmap;
                unsigned long background_pixel;
                Pixmap border_pixmap;
                unsigned long border_pixel;
                int bit_gravity;
                int win_gravity;
                int backing_store;
                unsigned long backing_planes;
                unsigned long backing_pixel;
                Bool save_under;
                long event_mask;
                long do_not_propagate_mask;
                Bool override_redirect;
                Colormap colormap;
                Cursor cursor;
            } XSetWindowAttributes;

        background_pixmap is either a pixmap, or None or ParentRelative;
        background_pixel  is   the   background   pixel;   border_pixamp
        specifies the border  of the window;  border_pixel is the  pixel
        value for  the  border;  bit_gravity is  a  bit  gravity  value;
        win_gravity is a window gravity  value; backing_store is one  of
        NotUseful, WhenMapped  or Always;  backing_planes specifies  the
        planes to be preserved if possible; backing_pixel specifies  the
        value to  be  used  in restoring  planes;  save_under  specifies
        whether bits  under should  be  saved; event_mask  is a  set  of
        events that should  be saved; do_not_propagate_mask  specifies a
        set of events that  should not be propagated;  override_redirect
        is  a  boolean  vaue  for  override-redirect;  colormap  is  the
        colormap to be associated with the window; cursor is the  cursor
        to be displayed, or None.
