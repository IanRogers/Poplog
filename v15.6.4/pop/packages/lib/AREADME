$usepop/pop/packages/lib/AREADME

This directory is now in popuseslist by default.
See
	$usepop/pop/lib/auto/popuseslist.p

It should be used ONLY for symbolic links to startup files
for packages in the directory:

	$usepop/pop/packages/

Anything else should either go into a new package or be added to
an old package or one of the system libraries, e.g.
	$usepop/pop/lib/lib
