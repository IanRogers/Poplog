-- 'Teach Network' ----------------------------------------------------

This option is used to train  a network using a particular example  set.
You will be prompted for the  network and example set names (unless  you
have stopped this  by setting  either or  both of  the 'Use  current...'
options on the Options Menu - see HELP *TRAININGOPTIONS). You will  then
be asked to confirm that you want  to train the network. If you do  then
NN_LEARN_EGS will be called. Any events you have defined via menus or by
directly adding them  to NN_EVENTS (e.g.  logging training  information,
re-calling the generator function)  will be called  after the number  of
cycles defined by NN_EVENT_TIMER.


-- 'Teach Selected Data' ----------------------------------------------

This option allows you to train the network on a particular example from
an example set. You  will be asked  to select an  example which will  be
taught to the network.


-- 'Test Network' -----------------------------------------------------

This option allows you to select a  network and an example set and  then
apply every example in the set to the network and get the output.


-- 'Test Selected Data' -----------------------------------------------

This option allows you to apply  a particular item from the example  set
to the network. You can  also type in your own  examples to see how  the
network responds to new input.


-- 'Apply Example Set' ------------------------------------------------

This option will ask  you to select  the network and  example set to  be
used (or  take the  current network  and  example set  if you  have  the
appropriate 'Use current...' options set) and then apply each example in
the example set to the network. The results are sent to the  appropriate
data destination (file, procedure,  another example set etc.)  according
to the data destination  flag and information. You  can then browse  the
results using the 'Browse Results' option described below.


-- 'Browse Examples' --------------------------------------------------

You can browse the examples used to generate the example set using  this
option. If the  examples were  obtained from a  file then  VED is  used,
otherwise the Neural structure browser is used instead.


-- 'Browse Results' ---------------------------------------------------

You can browse the results of applying an example set to a network  with
this option. The method of browsing depends on whether the results  were
sent to a file  (in which case  VED is used to  examine the results)  or
held within the example set (in which case a list browser is used).


-- 'Print Network Activation' -----------------------------------------

This option prints the activation of network.


-- 'Print Network Weights' --------------------------------------------

This option prints the connection strengths of a network.


-- 'Training Options' -------------------------------------------------

The 'Training Options' option allows  you to specify particular  options
which can be used to variables  which define whether to use the  current
networks or  example  set, how  many  times  should an  example  set  be
presented to  a  network during  a  particular training  cycle,  whether
examples should be  presented at random  etc. See HELP  *TRAININGOPTIONS
for more information.


-- 'Log Options' ------------------------------------------------------

This option takes you to the menu for defining what information, if any,
is written to a log file.
