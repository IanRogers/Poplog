HERE ARE SOME FILES WHICH MAY BE USEFUL WHEN SETTING UP
THE ENVIRONMENT FOR NEW USERS OF LINUX/UNIX POPLOG

IF I HAVE FORGOTTEN ANYTHING REQUIRED FOR THESE FILES TO WORK,
IT IS LIKELY TO BE IN

    ftp://ftp.cs.bham.ac.uk/pub/dist/poplog/bhamteach.tar.gz
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/bhamteach.tar.gz

The vedinit.p file in Poplib needs to be re-written: it's a mess.
I'll do it one day...

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Install poplog stuff in

    /usr/local/poplog/<name>

where name depends on the version, e.g. v15.53
    /usr/local/poplog/v15.53

2. Create this directory for local poplog stuff

    /usr/local/poplog/local

3. Copy or move this directory into

    /usr/local/poplog/local/setup/

4. Make a symbolic link

    ln -s   /usr/local/poplog/local/setup/bin/poplog /usr/local/bin/poplog

    (You may have to be root to do that).

5. Make sure that the paths in this file
        /usr/local/poplog/local/setup/bin/poplog

    are OK, e.g. for $poplogroot and $usepop


6. Users who want to tailor the environment for themselves can copy
   the contents of this directory

        /usr/local/poplog/local/setup/Poplib

    into their home directory (i.e. ~/Poplib) then try editing
    the files.

7. Make sure that you have /usr/local/bin set in your $PATH


Then you should be able to run Poplog using commands like:

    poplog pop11
    poplog xved &
    poplog xved <file> &
    poplog ved
    poplog prolog
    poplog clisp
    poplog pml

If you want to start up Prolog in Xved post to comp.lang.pop
or email pop-forum@cs.bham.ac.uk
asking how to set up a saved image which does that.
