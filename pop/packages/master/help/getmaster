HELP GETMASTER                                  Robert Duncan, July 1989


VED command for examining POPLOG master files.


    <ENTER> getmaster [options] <filename>


Note: this is a new, simplified version of GETMASTER; the previous
version is obsolete and has been deleted.


The command

    <ENTER> getmaster <filename>

opens a new (read-only) VED window on the named file, retrieved from the
current POPLOG master tree.

For example, the command

    <ENTER> getmaster C.all/plog/src/write.p

can be used to view the most up-to-date copy of the Prolog source file
"write.p".

The GETMASTER command is simply an interface to the more general
NEWMASTER command (see HELP * NEWMASTER). The command:

    <ENTER> getmaster [options] <filename>

expands to

    <ENTER> newmaster [options] get <filename>

so that the format of <filename> and the range of available [options]
are exactly as described in HELP * NEWMASTER.

In summary, <filename> must be an absolute pathname, or else a relative
pathname starting with 'C.' or 'S.'. This is interpreted relative to the
current master directory. The <filename> must be the last argument on
the command line.

Sensible options for use with GETMASTER are:

    -l (or: lock)
        Locks the named file. Noone else can install changes to the file
        while the lock is in force.
        Example:

            <ENTER> getmaster -l C.all/plog/src/write.p

        retrieves and locks the named file.
        NB: the locking mechanism only works correctly when invoked from
        the master machine (currently CSUNA).

    -v <version> (or: version <version>)
        Retrieves files from the alternative master tree named by
        <version>.
        Example:

            <ENTER> getmaster -v frozen C.all/plog/src/write.p

        retrieves the file from the frozen masters.
