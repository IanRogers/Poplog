LIB * NEWINTARRAY provides procedures which make and recognise
packed arrays of standard-size integers. These are suitable for passing
to external procedures that expect such arrays.

newintarray(bounds_list, element_init) -> int_array
    The arguments are as for *newarray. The second is optional.

oldintarray(tag, bounds_list, element_init) -> byte_array
    The last two arguments are as above, with element_init optional.

    The tag argument is an identifier such as a word or integer. If
    oldintarray is called twice with the same tag, the arrays
    returned may share storage. This can reduce garbage collection, and
    this procedure should be used in preference to newintarray for
    any array which is only needed temporarily. See *oldarray for more
    details.

isintarray(array) -> boolean
    Returns <true> if array is an array with a packed integer
    arrayvector, <false> otherwise. An array for which <true> is
    returned could have been created with newintarray, array_of_int,
    array_of_integer (see * EXTERNAL), or some other similar procedure.

The built-in intvec vector class is used for the arrayvectors. See REF
* INTVEC for details.
