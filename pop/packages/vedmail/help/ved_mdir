-- Using mdir to create a directory to messages in a mail file --------

In a file of Unix mail messages (such as the 'mbox' file, or the file
produced by the <ENTER> mail command), the command:

    <ENTER> mdir

produces a temporary file with the name of the original mail file at the
top and a directory or index to the messages in it. The <ENTER> gm
command described below can be used to 'go' to a message.

-- Format of index files ----------------------------------------------

In the index file produced by <ENTER> mdir, each message has a number, a
line number (which may become out of date if the file is edited) the
'From ...' line from the header, the 'To: 'line and the subject, e.g.

-- Using gm to go to a message ----------------------------------------

<ENTER> gm
<ENTER> gm <integer>

If done inside a mail directory produced by ved_mdir, this will make VED
go to the message corresponding to the number, in the file from which
the directory file was derived.

<number> defaults to the number at the beginning of the line cursor is
on.

E.g.

<ENTER> gm 3
    will Go to Message number '3:'.

<ENTER gm
    will Go to the Message specified by the current cursor line,
    provided the cursor is on one of the 'From ' lines in the index
    file.

VED_GM uses the rest of the line as a search string, so it will find the
message even if the file has been edited and line numbers have therefore
changed.
