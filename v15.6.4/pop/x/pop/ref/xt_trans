This REF file details the procedures that are suplied by the two library
packages LIB * FAST_XT_TRANS and LIB * XT_TRANS which provide the Pop-11
interface to the X  Toolkit functions that control  the mapping of  user
events to widget behaviour.

1  Introduction
---------------

The libraries LIB * FAST_XT_TRANS and LIB * XT_TRANS provide the  Pop-11
interface to the X  Toolkit functions that control  the mapping of  user
events to widget behaviour. These  allow the following operations to  be
performed:

   # Setting and reading of the multi-click time.

   # Compilation of a translation table

   # Merging  of  a  new  compiled translation  table  into  the
     current compiled translation table of a widget.

   # Removal of existing translations from a widget.

   # Compilation of an accelerator table.

   # Installation of accelerators from one widget onto another.

The  exact  structure  of  arguments  and  results  for  the   following
procedures is as discussed in REF * XTOOLKIT

        As for the procedures in LIB * XT_TRANS, but without checks  for
        valid arguments. These procedures should  only be used in  fully
        debugged programs. See  REF * XTOOLKIT for full  details of  the
        Poplog  X  naming  conventions  for  non-checking  and  checking
        procedures.
