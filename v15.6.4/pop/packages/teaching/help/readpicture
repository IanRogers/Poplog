HELP READPICTURE                             Steven Hardy, February 1978

    readpicture();

This procedure is used to read in pictures, and store them in the TURTLE
picture, for example:

    readpicture();
    ****
    *  *
    ****
    <EOF>

<EOF> means "type the end of file key" (usually CTRL-D on Unix machines
and CTRL-Z on VMS).  You have to type <EOF> to tell READPICTURE that you
have got to the end of the picture.

We can now DISPLAY the picture read in:

    display();
    ****
    *  *
    ****

READPICTURE can be used in a disc file as well except that you don't
type <EOF> to terminate the picture but instead READPICTURE takes the
end of the file as the end of the picture. For example, a file could
contain just:

     readpicture();
     ****
     *  *
     ****

Each character in the input is replaced by a word with that character in
the picture, except that if the character is one of the digits 0 - 9
then the corresponding number is used.
