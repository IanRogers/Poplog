-- . Flags ------------------------------------------------------------

The boolean flags you can edit are:

    Keep parsed examples
    Generate output fields as target data
    Use raw input data
    Use raw output data

-- . . Keep parsed examples -------------------------------------------

If this flag is true then  during a call to NN_GENERATE_EGS, any  parsed
examples will be held in  the EG_IN_EXAMPLES and EG_TARG_EXAMPLES  slots
of the example set record. Also, a call to NN_APPLY_EGS will ensure that
any unparsed examples are held in the EG_OUT_EXAMPLES slot (even if  the
eventual destination is a file).

If the flag is false then all these three slots will be set to false  as
the last action of NN_GENERATE_EGS and NN_APPLY_EGS. This is useful if a
large amount of data is likely to be generated or produced as output and
you wish to keep process size as low as possible.

-- . . Generate output fields as target data --------------------------

If this flag is true then  calling NN_GENERATE_EGS will ensure that  all
output fields are  parsed as target  results from the  network. This  is
usually the case when the example set is being used to train a network.

If this flag is false  will mean that output  fields are not present  in
the examples when calling NN_GENERATE_EGS.

-- . . Use raw input data ---------------------------------------------

If this flag is true then data structures obtained from the data source
are parsed using the datatype definitions provided when the example set
was created and the results assigned to the EG_IN_DATA and EG_TARG_DATA
slots of the example set record.

If this  flag is  false then  the data  taken from  the data  source  is
assigned directly to the EG_IN_DATA and EG_TARG_DATA slots. This implies
that the data source will  supply a 2-D array  of the required size  and
type for the network.

This flag defaults to false if the  data source is an example set,  true
otherwise.

-- . . Use raw output data --------------------------------------------

If this flag is true then contents of the EG_OUT_DATA slot are parsed
according to the output field definitions provided when the example set
was supplied before being passed to the data destination.

If this flag is false then the data taken from the EG_OUT_DATA slot  are
not parsed and the raw data is passed directly to the data destination.

This flag defaults to false if  the data destination is an example  set,
true otherwise.


-- . Example template -------------------------------------------------

The example template  is usually  a list  of lists,  where each  sublist
contains a definition of the direction,  datatype and field name of  the
field. The length of  the list is  therefore the same  as the number  of
data fields of the example set.


-- . Data source flag -------------------------------------------------

The data source flag is one of:

    file            - items read from files
    procedure       - items obtained by calling a procedure
    exampleset      - items obtained from another example set
    literal         - items entered directly by the user

Note that after  editing this flag,  you will almost  certainly need  to
edit the Source information flag (described next).

This option is not displayed if the example template contains  filetypes
since the data source will always be one or more files.


-- . Source information -----------------------------------------------

The  source  information  depends  on  the  value  of  the  source  flag
(described previously).

For "file" flags, you will be asked to enter one or more filenames.  The
number of  filenames  requested will  depend  on the  datatypes  in  the
example template. If they are all  filetypes then you will be asked  for
as many filenames as there are filetypes (see HELP *EXAMPLESETSMENU  for
information on specifying source file  names). If none of the  datatypes
are filetypes then you will be  asked for a single filename (since  each
example must be in the same file).

For "procedure"  flags, you  will be  asked  to enter  the name  of  the
procedure (this must already be defined).

For "exampleset" flags,  you will be  asked for the  name of the  source
example set.

For "literal"  flags,  there is  no  source information  required  and a
message will appear to inform you of this.


-- . Example data -----------------------------------------------------

Selecting this option will allow you  to edit the examples. If  examples
are from files then these will be displayed in a VED window and if  from
literal then  the  example structure  is  edited. You  cannot  edit  the
example data if it comes from a procedure or another example set.

For any changes to  take effect, you will  need to generate the  example
set.


-- . Data destination flag --------------------------------------------

The data destination flag is one of:

    file            - items written to files
    procedure       - items sent by calling a procedure with the values
                      as its only argument
    exampleset      - items transferred to another example set
    literal         - items held in the EG_OUT_EXAMPLES slot of this
                      example set

Note that after  editing this flag,  you will almost  certainly need  to
edit the Destination information flag (described next).

This option is not displayed if the example template contains  filetypes
since the data destination will always be one or more files.


-- . Destination information ------------------------------------------

The destination information depends on the value of the destination flag
(described previously).

For "file" flags, you will be asked to enter one or more filenames.  The
number of  filenames  requested will  depend  on the  datatypes  in  the
example template. If they are all  filetypes then you will be asked  for
as many filenames as there are output fields (see HELP  *EXAMPLESETSMENU
for information on specifying  destination file names).  If none of  the
datatypes are filetypes  then you will  be asked for  a single  filename
(since each output item must be in the same file).

For "procedure"  flags, you  will be  asked  to enter  the name  of  the
procedure (this must already be defined).

For  "exampleset"  flags,  you  will  be  asked  for  the  name  of  the
destination example set.

For "literal" flags, there is no destination information required  and a
message will appear to inform you of this.


-- Quitting From The Menu ---------------------------------------------

When you quit from this menu, you will be asked if you wish to call  the
generator function. If the data source is a procedure you will be  asked
to enter any arguments required by the generator function.
