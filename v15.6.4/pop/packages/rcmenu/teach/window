ENLARGING THE EDIT WINDOW

Notice how, if you invoke this teach file while you are in the middle of
another, the previous file remains visible on the other half of the
screen. (This won't be true if you are using XVED, the multi-window
version of VED).

You can change the size of the current window by clicking on the
WindowSize button on the Toplevel menu. If you are using XVED clicking
repeatedly will make the window cycle through five different size.

If you are not using XVED it will switch between two states.
    a. The current file uses the whole screen or window
    b. The current file uses only half the screen or window,
       allowing another file to be visible in the other half.

If you are not using XVED you can achieve this effect with the SETWINDOW
function, as follows:

    1. first press the key marked ESC (usuall top left of keyboard)
    2. then press the key marked "W" (think of W for "Window size").

If you are NOT using Multi-window XVED, try that now. Press the ESC key
and the W key in turn. Repeat a few times to see what happens.

Those two instructions will be referred to as the "ESC w" key sequence,
or sometimes "<ESC> w" as a reminder that there's a single key for ESC.

Experiment with the PageUP and PageDown keys with the large window and
with the small window.

When you quit a file, the 'editor' takes you back to the last file you were
looking at, i.e. it becomes visible on the screen. You will see the same text
as before.

You can quit this file by typing
    ENTER q RETURN
or
    ESC q
