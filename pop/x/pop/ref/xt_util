packages LIB * FAST_XT_UTIL and LIB * XT_UTIL  which provide the  Pop-11
interface to some general X Toolkit functions.

1  Introduction
---------------

The libraries  LIB * FAST_XT_UTIL and  LIB * XT_UTIL provide  the  POP11
interface to some  general X Toolkit  functions providing the  following
facilities:

   #  Conversion from a widget name into an actual widget instance.
   #  Simple memory management facilities.
   #  Managing shared graphics contexts.
   #  Translating widget coordinates to root coordinates.
   #  Translating a window instance into a widget instance.
   #  Defining widgets that have their own colour maps.
   #  Searching for a file in a path list.
   #  Search for a file using standard substitutions in a path list.

The  exact  structure  of  arguments  and  results  for  the   following
procedures is as discussed in REF * XTOOLKIT.

For more details see chapter 11 of:

2  LIB XT_UTIL
--------------

XtNameToWidget(widget, string) -> widget or false            [procedure]
        Translate a widget name to a widget instance.


XtFree(ptr)                                                  [procedure]
        Free an allocated block of storage.


XtGetGC(widget, gcmask, gcvaluesptr) -> gc                   [procedure]
        Obtain a read-only, sharable, graphics context.


XtReleaseGC(widget, gc)                                      [procedure]
        Release a shared graphics context.


XtTranslateCoords(widget, x, y, x_return, y_return)          [procedure]
        Translate widget coordinates to root coordinates.


XtWindowToWidget(displayptr, window) -> widget               [procedure]
        Translate a window and display pointer into a widget instance.


XtSetWMColormapWindows(widget, widgetlist, cardinal)         [procedure]
        Set the value of a widgets WM_COLORMAP_WINDOWS property.


XtFindFile(path, substitution, cardinal, filepredicate)      [procedure]
        Search for a file in a list of paths.


XtResolvePathname(displayptr, type, filename, suffix,        [procedure]
                  path, substitution, sub_num,
                  filepredicate)
        Search for a file,  using standard substitutions,  in a list  of
        paths.

3  LIB FAST_XT_UTIL
-------------------

fast_XtNameToWidget(widget, string) -> widget or false       [procedure]
fast_XtFree(ptr)                                             [procedure]
fast_XtGetGC(widget, gcmask, gcvaluesptr) -> gc              [procedure]
fast_XtReleaseGC(widget, gc)                                 [procedure]
fast_XtTranslateCoords(widget, x, y, x_return, y_return)     [procedure]
fast_XtWindowToWidget(displayptr, window) -> widget          [procedure]
fast_XtSetWMColormapWindows(widget, widgetlist, cardinal)    [procedure]
fast_XtFindFile(path, substitution, cardinal, filepredicate) [procedure]
fast_XtResolvePathname(displayptr, type, filename, suffix,   [procedure]
                       path, substitution, sub_num,
                       filepredicate)
        As for the procedures in  LIB * XT_UTIL, but without checks  for
        valid arguments. These procedures should  only be used in  fully
        debugged programs. See  REF * XTOOLKIT for full  details of  the
        POPLOG  x  naming  conventions  for  non-checking  and  checking
        procedures.


XptCoerceFilePredicate(proc) -> proc                         [procedure]
        This routine ought to coerce a pop11 file predicate procedure to
        an external form. Currently it does not - it merely checks for a
        valid external procedure. To be fixed by 14.1
