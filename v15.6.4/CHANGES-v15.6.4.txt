23 Sep 2010
    Installed new version of $popsrc/unixextern.p provided by
    Joe Wood, designed to support dynamic linking of 64bit libraries
    in 64bit Poplog.

5 Sep 2010
    Replaced temporary fix in $popexternlib referenced in item for
    11th Aug below, with more principled fix suggested by Joe Wood.
    This required modifying two files in pop/extern/lib
        c_core.c
        mklibpop

     See $usepop/pop/extern/lib/AREADME.txt

12 Aug 2010
    Started new version: V15.6.4
    Fixed $usepop/pop/com/popenv* not to look first in /usr/X11R6/lib
    Replaced some Poplog common lisp files with new files, provided
    by Waldek Hebisch, as described in
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/lisp-mods

    A lot of teaching examples are listed here
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/examples/

    Some online introductory videos on poplog and pop11 are being
    placed here (experimental still, as of August 2010):
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/cogaff/tutorials

11 Aug 2010
    Problem found running mklibpop on Fedora 13 to create libpop.a
        $usepop/pop/extern/lib/mklibpop

    Altered c_core.c in that directory temporarily
        See $usepop/pop/extern/lib/AREADME.txt

1 Sep 2009
    Hakan Kjellerstrand has started producing online information
    about Poplog, especially Pop-11, including new tutorial examples.
    See
      "The Pop-11 programming language and Poplog environment"
      http://www.hakank.org/webblogg/archives/001320.html

      "Off topic: The Pop-11 programming language and Poplog environment"
      http://www.hakank.org/constraint_programming_blog/2009/08/off_topic_the_pop11_programmin_1.html

        http://www.hakank.org/poplog/
            Includes Pop-11 models


    Hakan also reported that LIB GA required the newdatafile
    library, which was not included in the standard distribution.

    This has now been merged with the latest version of LIB DATAFILE
    (a procedure for storing datastructures in disc files and
    restoring them later).
    So LIB DATAFILE handles named procedures and simple closures
    of named procedures, in addition to distinguishing arrays
    organised by row and by column. See HELP DATAFILE
    LIB NEWDATAFILE is now redundant. It simply loads DATAFILE

    Some minor changes in
        $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt
        (Added two missing library files in teaching package:
            ga.p and newsolver.p )

    Added two new procedures for use with rc_graphic

        LIB xwd
            For dumping pop11 graphic window to file.
            See HELP XWD

        LIB rc_sleep
            Autoloadable procedure for sleeping between steps in
            drawing on the screen. Delay is determined by value of
            rc_graphic_delay (default false). See HELP RC_SLEEP

            This is now invoked by the drawing packages presented
            in TEACH RC_GRAPHPLOT, so the variable rc_graphic_delay
            can be used to control the speed of drawing graphs.

14 Aug 2009
    Minor alterations
    Changed the definition of procedure display in
        $usepop/pop/lib/turtle/turtle.p
    so as to print coordinates of turtle correctly.
    Also had to fix LIB regions.p

    Had to fix a number of broken teach and help files in
    $usepop/pop/packages/teaching

    Altered the file $usepop/pop/lib/lib/mkind.p so that it indexes
    the turtle directory, which it used not to do because of a typo.
    It also now indexes newc_dec in the packages directory.
    These changes extend the scope of ENTER sourcefile, and the
    procedure popindex, on which it depends. The indexes are created
    by $usepop/pop/com/mkind, which runs LIB mkind

    TEACH SEEPICS added, summarising TEACH SEEPICTURE

10 Aug 2009
    TEACH TEACHNUMS
    Another new teach file, introducing the problem of how to
    represent numbers and operations on numbers as lists and operations
    on lists. (Aimed at young learners).

    A section on support for teaching has been added to
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html

    namely
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/freepoplog.html#teaching

7 Aug 2009
    See last item about LIB SUPER. As there does not seem to be any
    tutorial introduction to the use of the library, a partial
    tutorial has been added: TEACH SUPER_EXAMPLE.P
    Also online here:
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/super_example.p

6 Aug 2009
    Hakan Kjellerstrand reported an obscure problem in LIB SUPER
    that stopped some of the examples working. This has been fixed
    by modifying the definitions of foreach and forevery. See
    LIB SUPER, HELP SUPER, HELP WHICH

5 Aug 2009
    pop_internal_version now changed to 156301

    A problem with Ved's error handling has been fixed. At one point
    Ved was altered to print syntactic (compile time) errors only on the
    status line. To get round this a library newvederror was added.
    However subsequent changes in poplog caused that not to work
    properly -- it produced spurious mishaps. The following changes
    have now been made
        1. $usepop/pop/com/mkstartup has been changed so that it no
           longer compiles newvederror.

        2. The file $usepop/pop/ved/src/vddoit.p has been altered.
           A new global variable vederrs_on_status controls whether
           syntactic (compile time) error messages are put on the
           status line or in the output file when compiling from a
           ved buffer. The default is false, i.e. don't put error
           messages on the status line. The problem with messages on
           the status line is that they disappear as soon as you type
           anything.

        3. The file vddevio.p has been altered. The updater of the
           active variable ved_chario_file accepts true as a value
           instead of causing an error.

    The file $usepop/pop/packages/vedutils/lib/newvederror.p has
    never worked properly and is to be withdrawn. Meanwhile it prints a
    warning message if compiled.


21 Jul 2009
    Added to $popcom, a shell script to create a saved image for
    eliza with speech synthesisers, i.e
        $popcom/mkeliza

17 Jul 2009

    [1] Added two utilities for invoking a speech generator

        Using espeak
            pop/lib/auto/speak_espeak.p

        Using flite
            pop/lib/auto/speak_flite.p

    [2] For now both have documentation only in the code. Each can
    handle a sentence in various formats (e.g. string, list of words
    or strings). The program using espeak has the ability to vary
    the speed of speaking.

    Added two new startup scrips that reside in this directory,
    which will normally be the $usepop directory

    poplog.sh
        for users of bash (and possibly ksh, or sh)
    poplog
        for users of csh or tcsh

    Each script must be run in this directory, which can be useful
    for testing, no matter where the directory is located, unlike
    the scripts bin/poplog and bin/poplog.sh created at installation
    time with the installation directory 'hardwired' into the
    scripts.

    See also the creation script: INSTALL/CREATE_SCRIPTS

    The poplog.sh script and poplog script can be used in one of two
    ways, namely either RUN with a poplog command or SOURCED without.

    If RUN with a command the effects are the same, e.g.

        poplog.sh xved
        poplog xved
            Both run xved, with all the environment variables set

        poplog.sh pop11 +clisp
        poplog pop11 +clisp
            Both run poplog common lisp, with all the environment
            variables set

    If SOURCED, the script should not be given an additional
    argument.

        source poplog.sh
            can be run by a user of bash to set the environment
            variables for poplog. After that poplog commands can
            be given without any prefix, e.g.

                pop11
                prolog
                xved myprog.p

        source poplog
            can be run by a user of tcsh or csh to set the
            environment variables for poplog. After that poplog
            commands can be given without any prefix, e.g.

                pop11
                prolog
                xved myprog.p

4 Jul 2009
    Moving documentation to a separate directory tree, whose
    contents are to be linked back. That way the tree can be
    shared with other versions of poplog. This includes
    documentation in $usepop/pop/packages, though I am not sure
    that's the right thing to do.

    See also $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

3 Jul 2009
    Removed $usepop/pop/packages/contrib (Saves about 8 MB)
    Downloadable from
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/contrib.zip

29 Jun 2009
    Began construction of v15.63
    Replacing all special characters from poplog documentation using
    stripvedfile ($usepop/pop/lib/lib/stripvedfile.p) to support users
    who do not wish to learn to use Ved/XVed

20 Feb 2009
    Two changes to popvision, described in
        $usepop/pop/packages/popvision/README.bham
        popvision/lib/Xcolour_to_rgb.p
            added directory '/usr/share/X11/rgb.txt'
            to  Xcolour_to_rgb_filelist

        popvision/lib/sunrasterfile.p
            Installed Jack Hollingworth's fix for updater
            of sunrasterfile for use on little-endian machines.

2 Dec 2008
    Installed changes designed by Waldek Hebisch to enable poplog to
    run without use of 'setarch' on linux with security settings.
    Source files altered:
        $popsrc/amain.s
        $popsrc/initial.p (just to change version)
        $popexternlib/c_core.c

    Altered installation scripts so that they no longer test for
    'setarch' requirement.

    For other minor changes see packages/CHANGES.txt

20 Jun 2008
    In LIB VED_DIRED
    Commented out the default key settings using vedsetkey, because
    (a) they caused autoloading errors, and (b) they could interfere
    with other uses of ^X in Ved commands.
    See HELP * DIRED

5 Jun 2008
    Copied latest version of packages directory to amd64 poplog
    Rebuilt saved images

5 May 2008
    Minor change to vedlatex findcites
    See $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

1 May 2008
    Minor change to lib popmatlab, to make HELP popmatlab work
    See $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

31 Mar 2008
    Another minor change to lib findcite.p, described in
    $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

27 Feb 2008
    Minor change to lib findcite.p, described in
    $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

7 Feb 2008
    Altered $usepop/pop/ved/src/vdfiles.p
    to avoid annoying bug: ved would not recognize that an existing
    file was being re-edited.

4 Feb 2008
    Altered version number to v15.6102

    32-bit Poplog
    Altered startup demos to work properly with setarch when
    necessary. For some reason alias definitions were not imported
    from sourced bash files.

    Added documentation for ved_highlight for simple highlighting of
    text files, and made the precise highlight command to be used
    user-definable.
        See REF * ved_highlight

    Added command $popsys/popsetarch for running commands
    with the 'setarch' prefix, e.g. things like pglink, pglibr

    See $usepop/pop/packages/CHANGES.txt

25 Dec 2007
    Modified the instructions for Ubuntu users in here
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.61

    Modified the
        CHECK_LINUX_FACILITIES
    script to draw attention (if necessary) to the instructions on
    the poplog web site for installing required instructions for
    Ubuntu users in here
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/v15.61

    Made the poplog startup scripts and some of the system scripts
    use 'bash' instead of 'sh', as the latter is linked to 'dash'
    not bash on Ubuntu, which can cause problems.

22 Nov 2007
    Added autoloadable file LIB ved_highlight
        $usepop/pop/lib/ved/ved_highlight.p
    ENTER highlight
        Goes through the current file underlining all the syntax
        words apart from brackets and punctuation symbols.

        This can be undone using ENTER strip

01 Oct 2007
    Tidied up $popsrc/unix-dir.p
    Changed pop_internal_version to v15.6101 in $popsrc/initial.p

29 Sep 2007
    Installed new version of $popsrc/unix_dir.p with changes provided
    by Waldek Hebisch to overcome problem accessing current directory
    reported in
    http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/bugfixes/BUGREPORTS
        18th Feb 2004

    Also rebuilt basepop11 and corepop in $popsys

    Cleaned up $usepop/pop/packages/com


11 Sep 2007
    Altered $usepop/INSTALL/poplog2.sh and $usepop/INSTALL/poplog2
    (used to create $usepop/bin/poplog.sh and $usepop/bin/poplog,
    respectively) so that they do a more sensible check whether to
    use existing $poplib, find ~/Poplib or ~/poplib, or use ~ if
    home directory contains init.p or vedinit.p and otherwise
    default to $usepop/Poplib

    The scripts are also altered to test whether to use setarch or
    not to execute commands.

10 Sep 2007
    Altered $popcom/popenv and $popcom/popenv.sh NOT to set poplib
    to default to ~

    Some minor glitches in the installation process have been fixed,
    by editing the main install script.

    $popsrc/syscomp/os_comms.p has been altered to generate a
    'bash' script rather than a 'sh' script for re-linking

        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/bugfixes

14 Apr 2007
    Copied stuff from Web eliza to packages/teaching/lib/elizaprog.p

11 Apr 2007
    Now version 15.61
    New install mechanism, including get-and-install-scripts
    new $popexternlib/c_core.c allows mklibpop to run on
        recent versions of gcc
    patches for Lesstif as described in
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/bugfixes/BUGREPORTS
    minor changes for ved and other utilities in
        $usepop/pop/packages
        (Still work to be done cleaning up packages and fixing
        headers)

29 Mar 2006
    Altered ved_lockfile so that the revised version of discappend
    checks for locks only if given a string argument.

29 Mar 2006
    Altered POPVISION: removed '-l' flag from exload commands

     straight_hough.p
     canny.p
     float_arrayprocs.p
     lapack.p

    This seemed to be needed to prevent the following warning in recent
    versions of linux
 ;;; Warning: can't open shared object /usr/lib/libm.so (Inappropriate ioctl for
 ;;;     device)

29 Mar 2006
    Altered RCLIB. Added rc_get_coords_from to allow a method like
    rc_get_coords to be used without warping the mouse pointer.
    See HELP RCLIB/rc_get_coords_from

29 Mar 2006
    Fixed documentation flaw in REF objectclass
    There were two entries for wrapper_kernel. One of them should have
    been labelled 'wrapper_invoker'.

1 Jan 2006
    More minor tidying up of packages and a small change to rclib.
    See $usepop/pop/packages/rclib/help/rclib_news

11 Jul 2005
    Slightly tidied up some of the code and documentation in
    pop/packages/vedmail

27 May 2005
    Fixed the script $usepop/bin/demos/simagent-demo to use
    'compile' instead of 'load', because the latter can have
    trouble reading in path names that include things like
    '-05-', which get read as '-5-'

23 Feb 2005
    Undid changes in two files made in 1999 to make them work with
    Lesstif. Changes no longer needed.
    pop/x/pop/lib/Xm/xmTextWidget.p
    pop/x/pop/lib/Xm/xmTextFieldWidget.p

19 Feb 2005
    Added lib generate_category to pop/packages/teaching/lib
        (Forgot to include it previously. It is needed for
        teach storygrammar, and used to be in $local/lib)

12 Feb 2005
    Bug and Fix reported by Waldek Hebisch

        Currently Poplog can handle at most 255 lvars. However it seems
        that there is no check for tha limit in the incremental compiler
        (there is a check in popc).  AFAICS this couses the lisp problem
        posted in comp.lang.pop

        Below a patch that implement the check:

17 Jan 2005
    Contents of $usepop/INSTALL revised,
    with new linking/rebuilding scripts
    See $usepop/INSTALL/INSTALL.txt

    Moved $usepop/man/bin to $usepop/bin
    Changed default $poplocal to be $poplogroot, i.e.
        the directory above $usepop

    Moved $local/setup/Poplib to $usepop/Poplib
        Contains default Xdefaults.poplog, init.p,
        vedinit.p and others.
