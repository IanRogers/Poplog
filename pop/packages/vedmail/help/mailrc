    uses vedmail

If you use the unix mailer you can have a file in your login directory
called .mailrc which contains two lots of information

(a) Definitions of email aliases so that when sending mail you
can refer to people via names that you find easy to remember, rather
than their full email addresses.

(b) Commands to control the behaviour of the unix mail program if you
use it.

-- Defining email aliases ---------------------------------------------
The .mailrc file can define email aliases in the format

    alias <abbreviation> name1 name2 name3 name4 ......

Then if you send mail to the abbreviation it will actually go to all the
names listed. Note that the names are separated by spaces, not commas.
If one of the names is itself an alias which is defined elsewhere in the
file then the alias will also be "expanded". So you can define four
aliase lists, called, e.g. list1, list2, list3 and list4, each for a
different group of people, and then if you often want to send mail to
all of them you could use an alias called list_all defined thus:

    alias list_all list1 list2 list3 list4

Here are some example aliases that may be useful for Poplog users at
Birmingham. The full addresses have been given so that these can be used
on Sun1. If you are already on the Computer Science network you can
leave out all occurrences of "@cs.bham.ac.uk"

alias advice  advice@cs.bham.ac.uk
alias unix-users unix-ug@bham.ac.uk


-- The ENTER aliases command ------------------------------------------

In VED there is a command for finding out about email aliases available
on the Computer Science network. It does not work on Sun1. It is
    ENTER aliases

It is described fully in HELP VED_ALIASES

-- Commands to control the Unix mail program --------------------------

This section can be ignored if you always read and send mail from inside
VED.

The full set of commands for this purpose is described in the Unix "man"
file "man mail" on the Computer Science suns, and "man mailx" on Sun1.
You can read man files in VED using the "ENTER man" command, e.g.

    ENTER man mailx

Besides the facilities in VED there are several Unix mail "front-ends"
i.e. programs for reading and sending mail. For many users the default
is set up (e.g. in their .cshrc file) so that the unix mail command gets
the Berkeley Unix mailer, as that is in many ways more convenient than
the other standard Unix mailer. It is sometimes known as "mailx", e.g.
on sun1.

Some of the most useful commands to control the behaviour of the
Berkeley Unix mailer are the following:

set autoprint
    If set this will mean that if you delete a message the next message
    is automatically printed

set crt
    This means that long messages will be printed via the "more"
    command, which shows only a screenful at a time.

set askcc
    If you send mail using the Berkeley mailer this will cause it to ask
    you if you want copies of the message to go to anyone. I.e. it will
    prompt you for a "Cc:" list.

set asksub
    This causes the mailer to ask you for a Subject: line for the
    message.

ignore Message-Id Received Mmdf-Warning Reply-To X-Errors-To Via
ignore Original-Sender Status X-Face X-Mailer X-Envelope-To X400-Received

    These commands tell the Berkeley mailer not to show mail header
    lines starting with the keywords given.
