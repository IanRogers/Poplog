HELP RC_SLEEP                                    Aaron Sloman 1 Sep 2009

RC_SLEEP()

This procedure uses the global variable

    rc_graphic_delay (default false)

If it is false, rc_sleep does nothing.

If it is an integer rc_sleep calls syssleep with that integer as
argument (hundredths of a second).

If it is a decimal number then it is multiplied by 100 and rounded.

So

    20 -> rc_graphic_delay:   rc_sleep will sleep for 0.5 seconds.

    1.5 -> rc_graphic_delay:  rc_sleep will sleep for 1.5 seconds
