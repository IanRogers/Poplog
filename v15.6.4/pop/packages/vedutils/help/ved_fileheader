HELP VED_FILEHEADER                                Aaron Sloman May 1997

The command
    ENTER fileheader

Produces a new file heading in something like this format:

    /*
    FILE:            /home/students/csai99/xyz/project.p
    AUTHOR:          Xavier Y Zonk
    CREATION DATE:   19 Oct 1999
    COURSE:          ???
    PURPOSE:         ???
    LAST MODIFIED:   19 Oct 1999

    */


You can then edit it to suit yourself. Remember to change the file name
if you move the file to another directory or change its name.
