-- Before Loading The Library -----------------------------------------

All the libraries available in Poplog-Neural make use of a number of
environment variables. These are:


1. HOST_TYPE

Set to be the name of the machine being used e.g. sun3, sun4, bobcat,
vax etc.


2. NEURAL_F77

Specifies whether a Fortran 77 compiler is available. This should be set
accordingly to "yes" or "no".


3. FLOAT_OPTION

This may already be defined on some UNIX systems. It specifies what type
of maths co-processor is available (if any). See ld(1) entry in your
UNIX manuals.

These should be defined in your .login (UNIX) or LOGIN.COM (VMS) file.


-- Printing Items -----------------------------------------------------

nn_pr_net(NETNAME)                                           [procedure]
        Prints information about the network to the screen.


nn_pr_egs(EGSNAME)                                           [procedure]
        Prints information about the specified example set.


nn_pr_dt(DATATYPE)                                           [procedure]
        Prints information about the specified datatype to the screen.


-- Commands -----------------------------------------------------------

NN_COMMANDS

NN_COMMANDS is  a list  of commands  which  can be  typed to  the  input
prompt. The current commands are:

    load            ved
    help            cd
    ref             ls
    teach           pwd
    doc             pop11
    lib             showlib

-- Menus --------------------------------------------------------------

Poplog-Neural is a menu-driven system. Menus have the following format:

    HD(menu) is a list of labels where:
        hd(labels) = menu title,
        tl(labels) = list of menu options.

    TL(menu) is a list of the values to be returned where:
        if the item is a list then the list is *POPVAL'ed before
        being returned,
        otherwise just the value is returned.


See HELP *NEURALINDEX for a list of on-line files. This file also
contains references to the files describing Poplog-Neural menus.
