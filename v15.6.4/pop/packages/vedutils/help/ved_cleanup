HELP VED_CLEANUP                                       A.Sloman Nov 1995

You can delete old versions of the file currently in VED by doing

    ENTER cleanup

You will then get a prompt that looks like this, on the status line:
    File written. Delete backup versions? OK?(n=NO,RETURN=yes)

If you type press RETURN it will then delete the backup files. If you
change your mind, press the N key and it will not do so.

So if your current file (in the VED buffer) is called

    test.p

Then this command will get rid of files called

    test.p-
    test.p--
    test.p---
