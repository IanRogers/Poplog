-- Introduction -------------------------------------------------------

This HELP File assumes that you are broadly familiar with the use of
Latex and Bibtex.

Bibtex file entries can take various formats, including the following,
with appropriate entries between the " " quote marks.

@InCollection{XXX95 ,
    author = "  ",
    title = "  ",
    booktitle = "  ",
    year = "  ",
    editor = " ",
    pages = "  ",
    publisher = "  ",
    address = "  "
}
@Inproceedings{YYY83 ,
    author = "  ",
    year = "  ",
    title = "  ",
    booktitle = "  ",
    pages = "  "
    publisher = "  ",
    address = "  ",
}
@Article{ZZZ85 ,
    author = "  ",
    title = "  ",
    journal = "  ",
    year = "  ",
    volume = "  ",
    number = "  ",
    pages = "  "
}

The general format is
    @<entry type>
    {<citation_key> ,
        <field1>,
        <field2>,
        ....
        <fieldn>
    }

Where each <field> is of the form
    <type> = "<text>"

Below is a list of entry types, showing which fields are required and
which are optional for each type. After that is a list of field types
and the abbreviations recognized by ved_bib. All this information was
obtained from the HTML files for Bibtex, referred to above.

Note that the <entry type> following "@" can be in any combination of
upper and lower case: the interpretation is not case sensitive. So
"@InProceedings" is equivalent to "@inproceedings" and "@INPROCEEDINGS".

The file HELP * VED_LATEX tells you how you can make use of such files
in your latex files.

You can use LIB VED_BIB to simplify the creation of such entries.

-- Using ved_bib ------------------------------------------------------

For each entry create something like the following, starting with the
citation you want to use in latex files, then on each line one of the
two character KEYS listed below, followed by a space followed by the
associated entry for the key.

beaudoin93
AU L.P. Beaudoin and A. Sloman
TI A study of motive processing and attention
BO Prospects for Artificial Intelligence
ED A.Sloman and D.Hogg and G.Humphreys and D. Partridge
    and A. Ramsay
PA 229--238
YE 1993
PU IOS Press
AD Amsterdam


Then mark the entry and do "ENTER bib".

Note: every line must start in column 1 unless it is a continuation of
the previous line.

The "ENTER bib" command converts the above to the following, after which
you can delete the unwanted headings (in this case all except
"@InCollection"):

@Article
@Book
@Booklet
@InBook
@InCollection
@InProceedings
@Manual
@MastersThesis
@Misc
@PhdThesis
@Proceedings
@TechReport
@Unpublished
{beaudoin93,
  author = "L.P. Beaudoin and A. Sloman",
  title = "A study of motive processing and attention",
  booktitle = "{Prospects for Artificial Intelligence}",
  editor = "A.Sloman and D.Hogg and G.Humphreys and D. Partridge
    and A. Ramsay",
  pages = "229--238",
  year = "1993",
  publisher = "IOS Press",
  address = "Amsterdam",
}


Note: all the entry types below can have an optional URL field, e.g.

    url = "http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/cogaff/",

-- --  Non-standard entry types

   Using these entry types is not recommended, but they might occur in
   some bibliographies.

   @collection
          A collection of works. The same as proceedings

   @patent
          A patent.

-- --  Standard fields

    (Written by Oren Patashnik).

   address
          Usually the address of the publisher or other type of
          institution. For major publishing houses, van Leunen recommends
          omitting the information entirely. For small publishers, on the
          other hand, you can help the reader by giving the complete
          address.

   annote
          An annotation. It is not used by the standard bibliography
          styles, but may be used by others that produce an annotated
          bibliography.

   author
          The name(s) of the author(s), in the format described in the
          LaTeX book.

   booktitle
          Title of a book, part of which is being cited. See the LaTeX
          book for how to type titles. For book entries, use the title
          field instead.

   chapter
          A chapter (or section or whatever) number.

   crossref
          The database key of the entry being cross referenced. Any
          fields that are missing from the current record are inherited
          from the field being cross referenced.

   edition
          The edition of a book---for example, ``Second''. This should be
          an ordinal, and should have the first letter capitalized, as
          shown here; the standard styles convert to lower case when
          necessary.

   editor
          Name(s) of editor(s), typed as indicated in the LaTeX book. If
          there is also an author field, then the editor field gives the
          editor of the book or collection in which the reference
          appears.

   howpublished
          How something strange has been published. The first word should
          be capitalized.

   institution
          The sponsoring institution of a technical report.

   journal
          A journal name. Abbreviations are provided for many journals.

   key
          Used for alphabetizing, cross referencing, and creating a label
          when the ``author'' information is missing. This field should
          not be confused with the key that appears in the cite command
          and at the beginning of the database entry.

   month
          The month in which the work was published or, for an
          unpublished work, in which it was written. You should use the
          standard three-letter abbreviation, as described in Appendix
          B.1.3 of the LaTeX book.

   note
          Any additional information that can help the reader. The first
          word should be capitalized.

   number
          The number of a journal, magazine, technical report, or of a
          work in a series. An issue of a journal or magazine is usually
          identified by its volume and number; the organization that
          issues a technical report usually gives it a number; and
          sometimes books are given numbers in a named series.

   organization
          The organization that sponsors a conference or that publishes a
          manual.

   pages
          One or more page numbers or range of numbers, such as 42--111
          or 7,41,73--97 or 43+ (the `+' in this last example indicates
          pages following that don't form a simple range). To make it
          easier to maintain Scribe-compatible databases, the standard
          styles convert a single dash (as in 7-33) to the double dash
          used in TeX to denote number ranges (as in 7--33).

   publisher
          The publisher's name.

   school
          The name of the school where a thesis was written.

   series
          The name of a series or set of books. When citing an entire
          book, the the title field gives its title and an optional
          series field gives the name of a series or multi-volume set in
          which the book is published.

   title
          The work's title, typed as explained in the LaTeX book.

   type
          The type of a technical report---for example, ``Research
          Note''.

   volume
          The volume of a journal or multi-volume book.

   year
          The year of publication or, for an unpublished work, the year
          it was written. Generally it should consist of four numerals,
          such as 1984, although the standard styles can handle any year
          whose last four nonpunctuation characters are numerals, such as
          `\hbox{(about 1984)}'.

-- --  Non-standard fields

   BibTeX is extremely popular, and many people have used it to store
   information. Here is a list of some of the more common fields:

   affiliation
          The authors affiliation.

   abstract
          An abstract of the work.

   contents
          A Table of Contents

   copyright
          Copyright information.

   ISBN
          The International Standard Book Number.

   ISSN
          The International Standard Serial Number. Used to identify a
          journal.

   keywords
          Key words used for searching or possibly for annotation.

   language
          The language the document is in.

   location
          A location associated with the entry, such as the city in which
          a conference took place.

   LCCN
          The Library of Congress Call Number. I've also seen this as
          lib-congress.

   mrnumber
          The Mathematical Reviews number.

   price
          The price of the document.

   size
          The physical dimensions of a work.

   URL
          The WWW Universal Resource Locator that points to the item
          being referenced. This often is used for technical reports to
          point to the ftp site where the postscript source of the report
          is located.


-- Capitalisation of titles: The global variable title_fields ---------

Bibtex normally reduces all characters in a book title or article title
to lower case, except the first. To prevent this you can insert braces
round the title. The ENTER bib command does this automatically for
book title and article titles if the keys "BO" and "TI" are in the list
held in the global variable title_fields.

By default they are in it.

global vars
    title_fields = [TI BO];

If you wish to include braces automatically in subtitle fields,
to preserve capitalisation, redefine this list as:

global vars
    title_fields = [TI BO SU];


-- Abbreviations using @STRING ----------------------------------------

The following information may be useful.

The @STRING command is used to define abbreviations for use by BibTeX
within the bibliography database file. The command

   @string{jgg1 = "Journal of Gnats and Gnus, Series~1"}

defines 'jgg1' to be the abbreviation for the string "Journal of Gnats
and Gnus, Series~1". Parentheses can be used in place of the outermost
braces in the @string command, and braces can be used instead of the
quotation marks. The text must have matching braces.

The case of letters is ignored in an abbreviation as well as in the
command name @string, so the command above could have been written:

   @STRING{JgG1 = "Journal of Gnats and Gnus, Series~1"}

A @string command can appear anywhere before or between entries in a
bibliography database file. However, it must come before any use of the
abbreviation, so a sensible place for @string commands is at the
beginning of the file. A @string command in the bibliography database
file takes precedence over a definition made by the bibliography style,
so it can be used to change the definition of an abbreviation such as
'Feb'.
