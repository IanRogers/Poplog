HELP VED_HEADERS                                       A.Sloman Jan 1998

ENTER headers

This command can be given in a Pop-11 program file. It will create a
temporary procedure index file containing a list of procedure headings
with their line numbers.

At the top of the index file it will include the path name of the file
from which the procedure index was created.

It includes all lines which start with
EITHER
    "define" followed by a space
OR
    tabs or two or more spaces, followed by "define" followed
    by a space.

Thus it should ignore lines produced by the

    ENTER indexify define

command, which start with exactly one space.

WARNING: procedure headers which start with exactly one space before
"define" will not be indexed.

ENTER gp

This command (GP = Goto Procedure) can be given when the Ved cursor is
inside a file created by the "ENTER headers" command.

It will go to the line number indicated at the beginning of the
line. Thus it is easy to get to the location of a procedure.

If you edit the original program file, the line numbers will change.
It is then easy to create a new index file, and typically very fast.

You can, if you wish, create several index files, corresponding to
several program files. Each index file will "remember" which program
file it came from, even if that file is no longer in Ved, in which
case it will read in the file when you select the procedure name
and give the GP command.

EXAMPLE

Try
    ENTER showlib river

then
    ENTER headers

then
    ENTER gp
