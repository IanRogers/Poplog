HELP MENU_XVED                                     Aaron Sloman Dec 1993

This menu provdes a very primitive menu for interacting with XVed
buffers using the "current selection", along with a few options for
moving or resizeing the current window.

The buttons available act as follows

    HELP
        Gets this file

    HelpSelection
        Gets Poplog HELP on the item currently selected. A bit
        like ESC h, except that it is not sensitive to previous
        modifier in the file. E.g. won't get REF, or LIB files.

    PasteSelection
        This makes a copy, at the current location of the last
        selected text, whether in this window or another.

    CopySelection
        Can be used to copy selected text from one place to another.
        Currently no different from PasteSelection

    CutSelection
        This deletes the selected text. (Similarly pressing the
        Delete key will delete it.)

    MoveSelection
        This moves the selected text from where it is to where
        the current cursor location is. It makes no attempt to
        tidy up. In some cases if deleted text is to the left of
        cursor on the same line, the insertion may not come where
        you expected it.

    ClearSelection
        This removes the highlighting of the selected text.

    UNDO
        This appears only to undo a few cuts.

    CompSelection
        This compiles the text selected, analogous to ENTER lmr.
        Puts output in file named in vedlmr_print_in_file. If the
        latter is true, inserts output in current file on line after
        the VED cursor location.

    NudgeUp
    NudgeDown
    NudgeLeft
    NudgeRight
        These four buttons shift the current window up, down, left or
        right relative to the screen. The amount of shift depends on the
        value of the variable ps_nudge_factor, which defaults to 25
        screen pixels.

    WindowSize
        This uses ved_setwindow to change the window size. It toggles
        through a range of sizes. For details SHOWLIB * VED_SETWINDOW
