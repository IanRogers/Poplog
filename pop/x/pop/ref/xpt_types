        A string  with  an  associated procedure.  Any  Xt  XEvents  are
        handled by looking for an action in the translation table  which
        is specified for that event.


ACTIONHOOKID                                                  [datatype]
        A unique identifier for an action hook procedure. An action hook
        procedure  is  called  just  before  every  action  routine   is
        dispatched  by  the  translation  manager.  It  is  created   by
        XtAppAddActionHook  and  has  XtRemoveActionHook  as  a  destroy
        action.


ACTIONHOOKPROC                                                [datatype]
        A POP action hook procedure.

        An   application   context   record   structure.   Created    by
        XtCreateApplicationContext, and XtWidgetToApplicationContext (if
        the application context was  not previously registered in  POP).

        implicit access procedure  XptImportDisplayPtr. It is  destroyed
        by XtCloseDisplay. Shell widgets  are dependent on a  particular
        display and this needs to be bore in mind when destroying them.
