If your login shell is bash and you have not installed the Birmingham
extensions, then

    define $usepop as an environment variable corresponding to where
    you installed the top poplog directory, referred to as ROOTDIR
    below. The default for ROOTDIR is
       /usr/local/poplog

    Do something like this with the appropriate directory:

        usepop=ROOTDIR/v15.53
        export usepop

    then do

        . $usepop/pop/com/poplog.sh

    You can put those commands into your .bashrc file so that they are
    automatically run whenever you login or start a new login shell.

which should have been installed in poplog as

    $usepop/man/man1/userguide.html
