-- For Cursor-addressable Terminals -----------------------------------

The following sections describe how to use the menus when  Poplog-Neural
is being used on standard terminals.

-- . Making Choices ---------------------------------------------------

Each option on the menu  is numbered and can  be selected by typing  the
appropriate number to the prompt followed by <RETURN>.

-- . Options Menus ----------------------------------------------------

The options  menus show  values of  variables which  you can  change  by
selecting the number of the option.  If the option is boolean, then  the
value will be toggled. If the value is textual then you will be prompted
for a new value. The  system will check that the  type of what you  have
just types is the  same as the  current value of  the variable and  will
prompt you for a new value.

-- . Quitting From A Menu ---------------------------------------------

Typing q <RETURN> instead of a number  will allow you to quit from  most
menus in Poplog-Neural. The main exception to this is the main menu (see
HELP *MAINPANEL)  which  has  a  'Quit'  option  which  will  exit  from
Poplog-Neural.

-- . File Commands ----------------------------------------------------

You can find out  which directory you  are in by  typing pwd. To  change
directory use cd followed by an optional pathname.

-- . Confirm Messages -------------------------------------------------

If you  are doing  an action  which may  result in  lost work  (such  as
deleting and  object  or exiting  from  Poplog-Neural), you  will  see a
question come up followed by a set of options e.g.:

    Really exit from Poplog-Neural (Exit, or Cancel) ?

You can choose the  option you need  by typing the  action or using  its
first letter (the prompt is  not case-sensitive). In the above  example,
you can type either "e" or "c".  If you type some other value, you  will
be re-prompted.


-- . Poplog Commands --------------------------------------------------

You can issue most  of the main  Poplog commands to  a menu prompt.  The
commands which are recognised are:

    help        - get a HELP file
    ref         - get a REF file
    teach       - get a TEACH file
    doc         - get a DOC file
    load        - load a file
    ved         - VED a file
    lib         - load a library file
    showlib     - examine a library file
    im          - get into immediate mode
    cd          - change directory
    pwd         - show current directory

In addition the command "exit" can be entered. You will then be asked to
confirm that you really wish to exit Poplog-Neural.


-- For X User Interface ---------------------------------------------

-- . Menu Selections --------------------------------------------------

If you have invoked Poplog-Neural  with the X graphical user  interface,
the method of selection depends on which flavour of X you are using. The
current alternatives are Motif or OPEN LOOK.

-- . Exceptions -------------------------------------------------------

Under Motif, pressing one of the different mouse buttons on the  network
toplogy window can bring  up one of three  different menus depending  on
what was under the pointer when the button was clicked and which  button
was used. However, only the right-mouse  button can be used to  actually
select the  option. This  is due  to the  way Motif  handles popup  menu
selection.

Users of OpenWindows 2.0  will find that mousing  on a menu button  with
the SELECT mouse button  will display the menu  rather than perform  the
default action  which  is  the  documented action  for  OPEN  LOOK  menu
buttons. OpenWindows 3.0 correctly performs the default action. This  is
bug in OpenWindows 2.0.

-- . Options Panels ---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you will select one of the options panels. This will  create a
new window with a number of options  on it. If the options are  boolean,
they can be  changed by  clicking on them.  If the  options are  textual
(e.g. names), then the value will appear in a box. Integers will  appear
in a box with arrows to the right  which can be used to alter the  value
of the contents of the box. To change the value, click the SELECT  mouse
button in the box, set the value as you want and then press <RETURN>.

In order for the change you have made to have any effect, you must press
the "Apply" button at the bottom of  the window. If you are unsure  that
the displayed value is the same as the associated variable, you can  use
the SELECT mouse  button on the  "Refresh" button to  update the  values
displayed in the options window.


-- For PWM User Interface ---------------------------------------------

If you  have invoked  Poplog-Neural  with the  PWM user  interface,  the
method of selection is pressing the left mouse on the option areas.

-- . Making Choices ---------------------------------------------------

When Poplog-Neural is  first started in  graphical user interface  mode,
you will see  the Poplog-Neural main  menu with a  number of options  in
boxes. Press the left mouse button on  one of these options AND KEEP  IT
PRESSED. For options followed by a  series of dots, a menu will  appear.
By keeping the mouse button pressed  and moving the mouse cursor up  and
down the menu, the  different options on the  menu will be  highlighted.
When the option you  want is highlighted, release  the mouse button  and
this option will be  selected. If you decide  not to select any  option,
move the cursor away from the menu and release the mouse button.

-- . Options Panels ---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you will select one of the options panels. This will create a
new window with a number of options on it. If the options are boolean,
they can be changed by clicking on them. If the options are textual
(e.g. words or numbers), then the value will appear in a box. To change
the value, click the left mouse button in the box, set the value as you
want and then press <RETURN>. It is very important that you press
<RETURN> when you have finished since that actually updates the variable
concerned (otherwise the window will say a value which is not the value
of the variable).
