The one Xpw addition to Xt is the use of methods instead of a collection
of global C procedures to perform widget-class specific operations  on a
widget. This REF file synopsises these methods.

1  Overview
-----------

The one Xpw addition to Xt is the use of methods instead of a collection
of global C procedures to perform widget-class specific operations  on a
widget. All widgetclass specific procedures in Xpw are accessed  through
a method-calling  process  using  the C  procedure  XpwCallMethod.  This
procedure takes a widget, a method  ID (integer), and a variable  number
of arguments according to the method. For all methods, there is a Pop-11
procedure which checks its arguments and then uses XpwCallMethod to call
the C  method.  The  method  name is  directly  related  to  the  Pop-11
procedure name, so the Pop-11 procedure XpwSetColor calls  XpwCallMethod
using the method ID XpwMSetColor:

       define XpwSetColor(widget, string) -> color;

         XpwCallMethod(widget, XpwMSetColor, string, 3, true) -> color;
         /* C procedure, taking 3 arguments and returning a result */

       enddefine;

If the widget is a subclass  of the XpwCore widget class,  XpwCallMethod
looks for the specified method ID in  a table held in the widgets  class
structure, and in the class structure of its superclasses.

If the method ID is found in the table, the associated method  procedure
is extracted and called.

The XpwCallMethod procedure is externally loaded into Pop-11. Because it
takes a variable number of arguments,  which can be of different  types,
LIB * EXTERNAL is  NOT used.  This means  that to  use XpwCallMethod  in
Pop-11 you must specify two  extra arguments, telling XpwCallMethod  how
many arguments you  are passing to  C and whether  the method  returns a
value or not. For example, the call:

        XpwCallMethod(w, XpwMDrawPoint, 10,10,      4, false)

Calls the  C XpwCallMethod  procedure  with 4  arguments, and  does  not
return a value.

In C, this  process is much  simpler. To call  the XpwMSetColor  method,
simply do:

        #include <X11/Xpw/XpwCore.h>
        /* using the XpwCore widget class */

        widget = XtCreateWidget('name', XpwCore, toplevel, ...);
        /* construct a widget */

        XpwCallMethod(widget, XpwMSetColor, "blue");
        /* call the method */
