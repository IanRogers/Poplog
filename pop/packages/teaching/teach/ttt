=== Teach Yourself Typing ============================================

Well not really! But there is a POP11 library program which will help you get
used to the layout of the terminal keyboard. Knowing your way around the
buttons will make it easier for you to get on with other tasks.

To make use of the program log in to POP11. To do this type your 'username'
on a terminal then press the button marked "return", or "linefeed",
or"newline", or "CR". If you don't have a username, then pretend your name is
POP11. When you type this, notice that the letter "O" is on the second row of
keys from the top. The number "0" is on the top row, next to the "9" key.

When POP11 is ready for you to type something it will "prompt" you by
making the terminal print a colon, thus
 :

You should then type
    TTT;

I.e. press the "T" key three times then the semi-colon (not colon)
key.

Then press the "return" button (or alternative), and wait.
The computer will print out instructions, and tell you what to do.
If you get fed up before the end of the "lesson", you can interrupt
by typing C whilst holding down the CTRL button.

Points to watch:

    Some of the characters require you to use the "shift" key.
    E.g. look for the ">" sign on a terminal. If it is on a button with two
    characters, and it is the upper character, then to type it you'll have
    to hold down the shift key, and whilst holding it, press the other key.

    If you make typing mistakes and notice them before you've pressed the
    "return" button (or equivalent), then you can correct the mistake. For
    instance
    1.# If you've mistyped three characters, then press the button marked
    "del", or "delete", or "rubout" three times. This will undo the last three
    characters.

    2.#If the line is a mess and you want to re-type it completely,
    then hold down the CTRL button, and type "U" (undo) once. The computer
    will print out an up-arrow then a "U", thus
            ^U
    then move the print head to the left of the paper. You can then start
    typing the line again.

    If you don't notice the mistake before pressing "return", the line will
    have gone into the system, and it is too late.
