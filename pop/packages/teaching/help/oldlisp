HELP OLDLISP                                    Jon Cunningham 1982

The command
    LIB OLDLISP;
will invoke an earlier version of the LISP system produced for teaching
purposes. Unlike the present LISP instead of compiling it translated into
POP-11, which could then be POPVALled.

* LISPTOPOP is a procedure which takes a single atom as argument. It tries
  to translate a file of that name and type 'lsp' from lisp to pop. Output
  goes into a file of the same name but type 'p'. It can be used either in
  lisp mode or in pop mode, e.g.
    : lisptopop("foo")=>
    ** baz
    ** foo
    : ved foo.p;
  It prints the names of any procedures defined in 'foo.lsp'. If the
  translation was successful, then 'foo.p' can be loaded as normal POP, but
  a limited number of procedures are translated into calls of POP procedures
  defined in the LISP system, so although normal POP code is produced, there
  may be some undefined procedures if the file is loaded into a normal
  (non-lisp) pop11 system.

* There is a procedure TRANSLATE. This translates a LISP expression into
  a list of POP items, suitable for POPVALing or POPPRINTing (see
  HELP * POPPRINT). This procedure can be used in POP mode or in LISP mode.
  See also LISPTOPOP. To see how LISP is translated to POP, try

    : translate(lisp_read())=>
    * (setq a b c d)
