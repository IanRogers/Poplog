HELP RMMASTER                                 Simon Nichols, August 1987

Shell command for removing files from POPLOG master directories.

    rmmaster [ -d master-directory ] file1 file2 ...


-- Description ---------------------------------------------------------

Files should be deleted from the master directories using RMMASTER
because:
    1)  in the case of a C. file, it removes all the links to S.
        directories and any diffs associated with the file;

    2)  it keeps a copy of the deleted file in a sub-directory of the
        masters called 'deletions', and records the deletion in both a
        file called 'DELETED' in the 'install' sub-directory and in the
        NEWMASTER logfile install/LOG.

RMMASTER can be invoked with any number of files as arguments; however,
each file must either start with a C. or an S. directory specification
or be an absolute pathname. For example, the following are both legal:

    rmmaster C.all/src/compile.p
    rmmaster $popmaster/C.all/src/compile.p

The optional "-d" argument is used to specify the master directory
explicitly and will not generally be required. The default is currently
set to $popmaster.

For obvious security reasons, RMMASTER can only be invoked by the userid
"pop".


-- Summary of Files Used -----------------------------------------------

    $poplocal/local/com/rmmaster
