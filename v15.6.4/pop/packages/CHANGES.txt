    Minor change to
        $usepop/pop/packages/vedutils/auto/ask_xved.p


1 Sep 2009

    Hakan Kjellerstrand reported that two library files referenced
    in teach files had not been included in the teaching
    subdirectory. They have now been added

        $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/lib/ga.p
            Referenced in TEACH GA
            This used facilities in LIB NEWDATAFILE, which was not
            previously included with the standard Poplog
            distribution. Its special features, namely the ability
            to handle named procedures and closures have now been
            added to datafile, so it no longer needs newatafile.

        $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/lib/newsolver.p
            Referenced in TEACH NEWSOLVER

15 Aug 2009
    Upgraded a number of teach and help files concerned with vision,
    in
        teaching/teach
        teaching/help
    e.g. seepics, sepicture, regions, grammarexamples, vturtle, respond

13 Aug 2009
    Added an experimental new teach file
    TEACH grammarexamples
    demonstrating the use of LIB GRAMMAR to explore ways of
    constraining a language by
    enriching the lexical and syntactic categories used.
    Also had to fix some of the library programs, including
    LIB turtle, LIB paintpicture, LIB regions

21 Jul 2009
    $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/lib/eliza_speak.p modified to use
    a female voice, using:

    sysobey('espeak -v+f4 -s 120 "'>< flatten(answer) ><'"');

18 Jul 2009
    Using the recently installed procedure speak_espeak(words),
    which invokes the linux command espeak to say the words, eliza
    has been optionally extended to speak its responses. See
    the new library procedure
        $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/lib/eliza_speak.p

    also
        $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/auto/haiku_speak.p
        Using the espeak utility.

17 Jul 2009
    Removed non-linux binaries from
    neural/bin

16 Jul 2009
    Fixed com/poplogout.sh to use bash syntax! It was essentially a
    copy of poplogout, using tcsh/csh syntax which had never been
    properly converted to bash/sh syntax.

14 Jul 2009
    Altered vedlatex/auto/ved_bib.p to use {...} instead of "...."
    for bibtex contents.

8 Jul 2009
    Altered vedmail/auto/ved_reply.p and vedmail/auto/ved_respond.p
    to prevent the marked range extending to next message, and some
    other minor fixes. See the revision notes in the files.

6 Jul 2009
    Altered teaching/auto/ttt.p (the typing tutor) to line things up
    better in Ved.

4 Jul 2009
    Moving documentation to a separate directory tree, whose
    contents are to be linked back here. That way the tree can be
    shared with other versions of poplog.

    Fixed ENTER rcdemo in rclib/auto/ved_rcdemo.p

    Updated some README files

    rclib/AREADME.txt
    sim/AREADME.txt
    prb/AREADME.txt
    newkit/AREADME.txt

3 Jul 2009
    Moved out $usepop/pop/packages/contrib
        (Saves about 8 MB)
    Downloadable from
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/packages/contrib.zip

24 Jun 2009
    Modified vedlatex/auto/ved_latex.p to include '.out'
    in the default latex_clear list. Value is now
    ['.aux' ^dvi '.log' '.bbl' '.blg' '.toc' '.out'],

20 May 2009
    Installed
        teaching/lib/rhino.p
            pop11 version of rhino game (hunter+camp)
        com/mkrhino
            script to make saved image

20 Feb 2009
    Altered
        popvision/lib/sunrasterfile.p
        popvision/lib/Xcolour_to_rgb.p

    See popvision/README.bham

2 Dec 2008
    Altered ved_decode.p in vedmail/auto/ so as to handle more cases,
    better.

8 Jul 2008
    Altered LIB schema in teaching package, to use pattern_instance
    instead of instance.

18 Jun 2008
    Made some changes to TEACH SOLVER and LIB SOLVER

    Replaced 'instance' with 'pattern_instance' throughout the
    library to prevent a clash with 'instance' in objectclass.

    Added global variable solverdelay, default 50 (hundredths of a
    second), to slow down the display in Ved to make it visible.

    Clarified and expanded the teach file.

6 Jun 2008
    Copied
        http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/projects/poplog/teach/opsys
    into
        $usepop/pop/packages/teaching/teach/opsys

5 May 2008
    Altered vedlatex/com/findcites and vedlatex/auto/findcite.p
    to include citeauthor citeyear

1 May 2008
    Altered popmatlab/popmatlab.p
    to extend vedhelplist to include HELP popmatlab

31 Mar 2008
    Yet another fix to
        vedlatex/auto/findcite.p
    to cope with interactions between pop11 syntax and latex file
    formats.

27 Feb 2008
    Put a temporary patch into
        vedlatex/auto/findcite.p
    to enable it to cope with \def or \newcommand used to
    define one of the 'citewords'. It simply reads to the end
    of the line. Ideally it should parse the whole command.

10 Feb 2008
    Slightly updated
        vedlatex/teach/latex
        vedlatex/teach/latex.tex

        vedlatex/help/latex
        vedlatex/help/ved_latex

4 Feb 2008
    Altered
        vedlatex/auto/findcite.p
        Added citenp to citewords

        teaching/auto/eliza.p
        No longer attempts to run saved image.
        (Compiling elizaprog is fast enough)

    Updated
        vedlatex/help/findcite

    Installed shell script
        vedlatex/com/findcites

29 Sep 2007
    Updated contents of com/ subdirectory
    Various other changes and updates in packages not recorded here

14 Mar 2005
    Slight change to the emacs package
