the  equivalent  C  structures  and  functions  for  manipulating   user
preferences.

XKeyboardControl                                               [typedef]
        This  data  structure  is  used  by  the  XChangeKeyboardControl
        procedure.

            typedef struct {
                    int key_click_percent;
                    int bell_percent;
                    int bell_pitch;
                    int bell_duration;
                    int led;
                    int led_mode;
                    int key;
                    int auto_repeat_mode;
            } XKeyboardControl;

        auto_repeat_mode is one of On, Off or Default.


XKeyboardState                                                 [typedef]
        This  data  structure   is  used   by  the   XGetKeyboardControl
        procedure.

            typedef struct {
                int key_click_percent;
                int bell_percent;
                unsigned int bell_pitch, bell_duration;
                unsigned long led_mask;
                int global_auto_repeat;
                char auto_repeats[32];
            } XKeyboardState;


XAutoRepeatOff(DspPtr)                                       [procedure]
XAutoRepeatOn(DspPtr)                                        [procedure]
        XAutoRepeatOff   turns   the    keyboard's   auto-repeat    off.
        XAutoRepeatOn turns the keyboard's auto-repeat on.


XGetDefault(DspPtr,string1,string2) -> CharPtr               [procedure]
        The number of options that a program may need can be very  large
        in the  X  environment.  (Fonts  of  various  sorts,  colors  of
        characters, mouse,  background,  text,  cursor,  etc.)  If  only
        command line options  could be  used to specify  each of  these,
        things quickly  become unmanageable  as your  tastes in  windows
        will  often  be  drastically  different  from  someone   else's.
        XGetDefault makes it easy  to find out what  the user wants  for
        his favorite font,  colors, etc. Its  use is highly  encouraged.
        Defaults are read  out of  a file called  "~/.Xdefaults" in  the
        user's home directory. See the X manual page for details of  its
        format. Typically, an entry in .Xdefaults will be of the form:

            program_name.variable: setting

        XGetDefault  returns  CharPtr,  a  pointer  to  a  copy  of  the
        `setting' for program_name string1 and variable named string2.


XBell(DspPtr,int)                                            [procedure]
XGetKeyboardControl(DspPtr,XKeybStatePtr)                    [procedure]
XChangeKeyboardControl(DspPtr,ulong,XKeybControlPtr)         [procedure]
        These procedure implement the  equivalent C functions.
