1  Introduction
---------------

The libraries LIB * FAST_XT_POPUP and LIB * XT_POPUP provides the Pop-11
interface to the X  Toolkit Intrinsics related  to "popup" widgets.  The
procedures  in  this  library  allow  the  following  functions  to   be
performed:

  # Creation of a popup shells.
  # Mapping/unmapping of popup shells.
  # Creation of "spring-loaded" popup shells.
  # Convenience callback procedures to map popup shells.

The  exact  structure  of  arguments  and  results  for  the   following
procedures is as discussed in REF * XTOOLKIT

For full details see chapter 5 of:

        As for the procedures in LIB * XT_POPUP, but without checks  for
        valid arguments. These procedures should  only be used in  fully
        debugged programs. See  REF * XTOOLKIT for full  details of  the
        POPLOG  X  naming  conventions  for  non-checking  and  checking
        procedures.


raw_XtCallbackNone                                                [vars]
        Variable containing  the  external C  procedure  XtCallbackNone,
        which can  be  used as  a  faster alternative  to  the  callback
        procedure fast_XtCallbackNone.


raw_XtCallbackNonexclusive                                        [vars]
        Variable     containing     the     external     C     procedure
        XtCallbackNoneexclusive,  which  can   be  used   as  a   faster
        alternative       to        the        callback        procedure
        fast_XtCallbackNoneexclusive.


raw_XtCallbackExclusive                                           [vars]
        Variable     containing     the     external     C     procedure
        XtCallbackEexclusive, which can be used as a faster  alternative
        to the callback procedure fast_XtCallbackEexclusive.


raw_XtCallbackPopdown                                             [vars]
        Variable containing the external C procedure  XtCallbackPopdown,
        which can  be  used as  a  faster alternative  to  the  callback
        procedure fast_XtCallbackPopdown.
