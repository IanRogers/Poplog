-- 'Example Sets ...' -------------------------------------------------

The 'Example Sets ...' option will take you to the Example Set Menu.
This menu is used to create and manipulate the teaching and testing data
used to train networks. The following are options are available:

    New             - create a new datatype
    Generate        - calls the function used to generate examples
                      for a particular example set
    Display         - display an existing datatype
    Edit            - edit a datatype definition
    Copy            - create a copy of an example set
    Delete          - delete an example set
    Set Current     - define which datatype is currently of most interest
    List All        - display a list of all currently defined datatypes
    Load            - load one or more datatypes from disk
    Save            - save one or more datatypes to disk

See HELP *EXAMPLESETSMENU for more information.


-- 'Networks ...' -----------------------------------------------------      

Selecting the 'Networks ...' option will take you to the Network Menu.                     
This menu has the following options on it:

    New             - create a new network
    Display         - display an existing network
    Edit            - edit any parameters associated with a network
    Copy            - duplicate a network
    Delete          - delete a network
    Set Current     - define which network is currently of most interest
    List All        - display a list of all currently defined networks
    Load            - load one or more networks from disk
    Save            - save one or more networks to disk

See HELP *NETWORKSMENU for more information.


-- 'Datatypes ...' ----------------------------------------------------

This menu option will take you to the Datatypes Menu which is used for
manipulating definitions of datatypes. This menu has the following
options:

    New             - create a new datatype
    Display         - display an existing datatype
    Edit            - edit a datatype definition
    Delete          - delete a datatype        
    Set Current     - define which datatype is currently of most interest
    List All        - display a list of all currently defined datatypes
    Load            - load one or more datatypes from disk
    Save            - save one or more datatypes to disk

See HELP *DATATYPESMENU for more information.


-- 'Teach/Test ...' ---------------------------------------------------

Once have defined some networks and example sets (and any new datatypes
you might need), this menu can be used to train the networks on the
examples created and test how well the networks have learnt to respond
to the input data. The Teach And Test Menu has the following options:

    Teach Example Set           - teaches a complete example set of
                                  data to a specified network
    Teach Selected Data         - teaches a particular example from an
                                  example set to a network
    Test Example Set            - applies each example in an example set
                                  to a network and stores the results
    Browse Results              - used to browse the results after
                                  testing an example set
    Test Selected Data          - allows the user to specify new
                                  examples to select to be applied to
                                  a network
    Print Network Activation    - displays the current state of the
                                  network activation
    Print Network Weights       - displays the strength of all
                                  connections in a network

-- 'Help ...' ---------------------------------------------------------

Selecting this option takes you to the Help Menu through which you can
select and access the major categories of on-line documentation. The
menu has the following options:

    Introduction                - introduction to neural networks
    Poplog-Neural               - overview and tutorial on
                                  Poplog-Neural
    Teaching Networks           - functions for training neural networks
                                  (LIB *NETTRAINING)
    Generic Functions           - utility functions provided by the
                                  *NETGENERICS library
    Back-propagation nets       - functions provided by the
                                  back-propagation library, *BACKPROP
    Competitive Learning nets   - functions provided by LIB *COMPLEARN,
                                  for competitive learning networks
    Index                       - index of on-line documentation, as
                                  well as a list of functions and which
                                  library provides them


-- 'Quit' -------------------------------------------------------------

Selecting this option will allow you to quit from Poplog-Neural. You
will be asked to confirm this selection. If you do confirm the 'Quit'
then all unsaved networks, datatypes and example sets will be lost.
