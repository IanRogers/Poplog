LIB SOMESCHEMATA

This library file sets up some 'stories' and some story 'schemas' which
can be used as examples with LIB SCHEMA (see HELP * SCHEMA).

It also defines a procedure IDENTIFY, which calls SCHOOSE (described in
HELP * SCHEMA). Example use:

    story4==>
    ** [[john is going to holland]
        [john phones cooks]
        [cooks phones british airways]
        [cooks writes ticket to holland for john]]
    identify(story4);
    ** [sorry same = 1 missing = 3 extra = 3]
    ** [garage same = 1 missing = 5 extra = 3]
    ** [date same = 1 missing = 3 extra = 3]
    ** [bookticket same = 4 missing = 4 extra = 0]
    ** [best is bookticket]
    ** [this suggests]
    ** [cooks is a travel agent]
    ** [john asks for ticket to holland]
    ** [british airways is a airline]
    ** [cooks asks for reservation to holland]
    ** bookticket
