INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. Go to local directory

    cd $poplocal/local

2. If ved_latex exists, rename it, to protect old versions of files

    mv ved_latex ved_latex.old

3. Extract the tar files

    Unpack the contents of the tar file --- which will create
        $poplocal/local/ved_latex

    I.e. do this:

    zcat .../ved_latextar.gz | tar xvf -

The Unix command

    ls -l ved_latex

should now produce something like the following listing

ls -l ved_latex
total 20
drwxr-sr-x   2 axs      poplog       512 Dec 13 17:49 auto
drwxr-sr-x   2 axs      poplog       512 Dec 13 17:03 help
-rwxrwxr-x   1 axs      poplog      1374 Dec 25  1996 latex.install
-rwxrwxr-x   1 axs      poplog       547 Dec 25  1996 latex.tar
-rw-rw-r--   1 axs      poplog      2627 Dec 25  1996 README
drwxr-sr-x   2 axs      poplog       512 Dec 13 17:22 teach


4. Install lnks in standard local directories

If directories these directories do not exist
    $poplocal/local/auto
    $poplocal/local/help
    $poplocal/local/teach

then create them or make sure that permissions are set so as to allow
them to be created by latex.install script. The directories must be
writeable by whoever is doing the installation.

4. Run the shell script
    ved_latex/latex.install

This will make links in the help, auto and teach directories to the
files in this directory, after first saving old versions in a directory
called saved. Check the contents of this directory in case something
precious is about to be removed! Otherwise you can remove the contents
of the saved directory.
