HELP STOREPICTURE                            Steven Hardy, February 1978

    storepicture(<filename>);

This procedure is used to store the current TURTLE picture in a file
called <filename>. The file will include a call of *READPICTURE, so that
it can subsequently be loaded to restore the picture.

For example, to save the current picture in a file called "pic.p", do

    storepicture("pic");

STOREPICTURE automatically adds '.p' to <filename> if it is a word. (If
<filename> is a string, it is used literally).
